Experts think geothermal energy is the answer for increasing energy demands, which works by pumping water into bedrock, and currently over 60% of Kenya's power comes from hydroelectric sources but these are proving increasingly unreliable as the issue of seasonal variation is intensified by erratic rain patterns, but the steam can be used to drive turbines and produce electricity.

The influence of the mass media, including TV and newspapers has become an integral part of the rising debate in the present world. While proponents of the argument are in favor, the opponents are completely against the relevance of the influence on the younger generation. In my opinion, the mass media, including TV and newspapers, have a great influence on humans, particularly on the younger generation, and this influence has more positive impacts than negatives around the globe.

To begin with, there are several factors in favor of my belief. The most prominent reason is that the information is wealth and it comes from mass media as we are living in this technology era. According to the research conducted by Western Sydney University, ninety percent of people say that they totally depend on social networks, TV and newspapers to learn current affairs and they are quite convenient in provind the information people need. Secondly, nowadays schools and universities have started teaching their students to use internet for their academic activities because teachers believe that mass media is major source of knowledge.

On the other hand, critics may point out that one of the most significant disadvantages is that these mass media reduces the human interaction. For instance, a survey conducted in the United States reveals that seventy-five percent of people spend their 5 hours a day using mass media which is a negative factor.

In conclusion, even when there are several demerits associated with the influence of mass media, the advantages outweigh the disadvantages and social media, TV and newspapers have become a crucial part of our lives. Therefore, efficient use of mass media should be promoted. However, its misuse should be condemned.

Human factors, with its 
emphasis
 on user- or person-centered design, can help to ensure that health care in the home suits the people, the tasks, and the environments involved and that the care provided is safe, 
effective
 and efficient. According to the International Ergonomics Association, “[Human factors] is the scientific discipline concerned with the understanding of interactions among humans and other elements of a system, and the 
field
 that applies theory, principles, data, and other methods to design in order to optimize human well-being and overall system performance” (International Ergonomics Association, 2010).Human factors is 
so
 concerned with applying what is known about human behavior, abilities, limitations, and other characteristics to the design of systems, tasks/activities, environments, and equipment/technologies. It is also concerned with the design of training programs and instructional materials that 
support
 the performance of tasks or the use of technology/equipment.


The study of objects constitutes a relatively new field of academic enquiry, commonly 
referred to
 as material culture studies. Students of material culture seek to understand societies, both past and present, through careful study and 
observation
 of the physical or material objects generated by those societies. The source material for study is exceptionally wide, 
including
 not just human-made artefacts but also natural objects and even preserved body parts (as you saw in the film 'Encountering a body’). Some specialists in the field of material culture have made bold claims for its pre-eminence. In certain disciplines, it reigns 
supreme
. It plays a critical role in archaeology, for example, especially in circumstances where written evidence is either patchy or non-existent. 
In such cases
, objects are all scholars have to rely on in forming an understanding of ancient peoples. Even where written documents survive the physical remains of literate cultures often help to provide new and interesting insights into how people once lived and thought, 
as in
 the case of medieval and post-medieval archaeology. In analysing the physical remains of societies, both past and present, historians, archaeologists, anthropologists and others have been careful to remind us that objects mean different things to different people.


A University of London team found that people who went with their initial response on a test of visual perception (questions included picking out an anomaly in a pattern of symbols) did better than those who were given more time to ponder. 
Whereas
 the subconscious brain recognized a rotated version of the same symbol as different, the conscious brain reasoned that 'an apple is still an apple whether rotated or not', the researchers on the project 
concluded
 . When the subjects had time to engage their higher-level functions 
instead
 of relying on their intuitive responses, they were more 
likely
 to be wrong.


A giant turtle made from discarded plastic trash will greet visitors to the British Science Festival this week. The plastic containers, bottles and cups were collected locally in Hull, where the event is taking place at the city’s university. Standing 3.5m tall (11.5ft), the art installation 
has
 commissioned by the University of Hull with the aim of raising awareness of plastic waste. Professor Dan Parsons, director of the university’s Energy and Environment Institute, said: “Marine pollution is a mounting global challenge, which is already having 
devastating
 consequences. “We have a duty to protect these fragile environments and the marine life and ecosystems which we 
call
 home. The university has commissioned this installation as a physical 
reminder
 of what is ending up in the oceans, but also to ask visitors to campus to stop and think what they could do to try to reduce their own waste.”


A new interdisciplinary centre for the study of the frontiers of the universe, from the tiniest subatomic particle to the largest chain of galaxies, has been formed at The University of Texas at Austin. The Texas Cosmology Center will be a way for the university's departments of Astronomy and Physics to 
collaborate
 on research that concerns them both “This centre will bring the two departments together in an area where they 
overlap
 - in the physics of the very early universe,” said Dr.Neal Evans, Astronomy Department chair. Astronomical observations have 
revealed
 the presence of dark matter and dark energy, discoveries that challenge our knowledge of fundamental physics. And today's leading theories in physics involve energies so high that no Earth-bound particle accelerator can test them. They need the universe as their 
laboratory
. Steven Weinberg, Nobel laureate and professor of physics at the university, called the Centre's 
advent
” a very exciting development “for that department.

Mathematics and statistics play a part in almost all daily activities. They are at the heart of advances in science and technology, as well as providing indispensable problem-solving and decision-making tools in many areas of life.They underpin the rigorous analysis and modelling required for new policies, designs and systems. Mathematical and statistical knowledge is much sought after by employers for a wide variety of jobs, not least in teaching the subject, and a qualification in any one of the areas we offer can bring real benefits in your professional life.

The trigger point causes the rest of the fiber segments to be extended to capacity. It becomes a tight band. Normally the regular contracting and releasing of these little segments circulates blood in the capillaries that supply them (the segments) with their nutrients. When they hold this contraction, blood flow is stopped to that area, there is not an oxygen supply, and waste products are not pushed out. The trigger point then sends out pain signals until the trigger point is put in a position of rest again.

An Australian sheep farmer paid his own unique tribute to his beloved aunt. Due to pandemic restrictions , Ben Jackson was unable to attend his aunt Deb’s funeral that took place 400 kilometers away. He scattered grain in the shape of a heart in a field, so that thousands of sheep would come into the field and fill up the vast shape. Like many families separated during the pandemic, Jackson wasn’t able to say goodbye to a loved one, and he felt hopeless.

So why does this happen? Well, the presence of others increases your 
arousal
 or your general 
physiological
 or psychological excitement. Things like your heart rate increasing, you may be breathing quicker than usual. It’s the activation of your own of nervous system 
actually
. And, this is simply known as nervous energy. Your increased energy arousal leads to the 
likelihood
 of the dominant response occurring. So whether the dominant response is correct or 
accurate
 depends on how easy or difficult the task is, and how well you’ve learned it, or rehearsed it. So the presence of others will likely improve your performance on simple tasks or tasks that you’ve learned well over a course of time, and it’ll 
hinder
 your performance on difficult tasks or tasks that you haven’t practiced.


And many sufferers don’t know the cause or the 
solution
 to their problem. The majority of our patients at the clinic 
tend
 to be women. They are especially 
vulnerable
 because of pregnancy but also because of 
osteporiosis
, which I personally believe to be the major cause of problems for women. I have many women patients who say they have completely given up exercise because the pain makes them so 
miserable
. But of course that starts up a 
vicious
 circle.

    There has been increased research interest in the use of active video games (in which players physically interact with images onscreen) as a means to ______ physical activity in children. The aim of this review was to assess active video games as a means of increasing energy expenditure and physical activity behavior in children. Studies were obtained from computerized searches of multiple electronic bibliographic databases. The last search was conducted in December 2008. Eleven studies focused on the quantification of the energy cost associated with playing active video games, and eight studies focused on the utility of active video games as an _______ to increase physical activity in children. Compared with traditional non-active video games, active video games ________ greater energy expenditure, which was similar in intensity to mild to moderate intensity physical activity. The intervention studies indicate that active video games may have the potential to increase free-living physical activity and improve body _______ in children; however, methodological limitations prevent _______ conclusions. Future research should focus on larger, methodologically sound intervention trials to provide definitive answers as to whether this technology is effective in ________ long-term physical activity in children.

    Currently, there is concern about the increasing amount of time children spend _______ in sedentary activities, the number of children who fail to achieve ________ daily physical activity guidelines (i.e. 60 min of moderate-to-vigorous intensity activities every day), and the apparent increase in obesity prevalence as a result of such sedentary ________. Screen-based activities, including television viewing and playing computer games, are __________ of the most frequently observed sedentary activities that children partake with children spending 2.5–4 h per day participating in such activities. The introduction of “active video games” (AVGs) into the gaming market presents an opportunity to convert traditional, sedentary screen-time into active screen-time and thus increases total daily energy expenditure (EE). Modern AVGs utilize cameras and motion sensors to allow the gamer to physically perform a variety of actions, dependent on the console, such as swinging a tennis racquet or running. The most demanding AVGs provided similar responses to walking and, based on international standards, should be classified as low-intensity activities. Whilst AVGs may provide children with a better alternative to sedentary gaming, they are not a sufficient _________ for normal physical activity, e.g. sports and outdoor play.

#196 Love of Reading
    Many parents want their children to grow up with a love of reading. However, recent research _______ that children nowadays spend far more of their time using their phones or computers than reading books.

#1082 Existentialism
    Existentialism is a philosophical movement that became prominent in the 20th century, particularly in the years _________ World War II. At its core, existentialism emphasizes the individual human being’s freedom and responsibility to give meaning to their own life. Key existentialist philosophers like Jean-Paul Sartre and Kierkegaard argued for the primacy of existence over essence. This means they believed that human beings define themselves through the choices they _______ and the actions they take, rather than having some ________ essence or nature that defines who they are. As Sartre famously stated, “existence precedes essence.” This focus on subjective experience and individual freedom leads to the existentialist view that each person must create meaning for themselves in an objectively meaningless and absurd universe. Existentialists do not believe there is any __________ meaning or purpose given by a divine being or human nature - there is only the meaning we each generate. This places the _________ and responsibility of making choices and directing one’s life solely on the individual.

#1085 Nature Benefits
    A new study from the University of Vienna shows that regular _______ with nature can have positive effects on mental health, especially for people with lower incomes.

Initial research suggested that dogs might lack this complexity in their visual system, leading to the conclusion that they could only perceive the world in _______ of gray. Modern research, however, has shown that dogs do see colors, but their color vision is limited compared to humans.

#1093 Sign Languages
    Evidence suggests ancient Egyptians and Greeks used hand gestures to supplement communication. Yet, it wasn't _______ the 17th century in Europe that formal sign languages began to flourish. Institutions for the deaf _______, and with them, educators like Charles-Michel de l'Épée in France, who developed systems using manual alphabets and gestures. Like languages spoken, sign languages diversified. American Sign Language (ASL), for instance, branched out from French Sign Language, carrying echoes of its European cousin but forging its own ________ identity. This evolution wasn't confined to geography. Within communities, nuances emerged, reflecting regional dialects and cultural experiences. Deaf communities thrived, stories weaving through generations, jokes punctuated by laughter translated into expressive movements. However, the _______ wasn't paved with only sunshine. The 19th century saw the rise of oralism, a push to prioritize spoken language for the deaf. Sign languages were deemed inferior, relegating them to the shadows. Thankfully, the pendulum swung back. The late 20th century _________ a resurgence of sign languages, recognized as complete and complex systems with rich grammar and expressive power.

Instead, it encountered obstacles and challenges, particularly during the 19th century with the emergence of oralism, which advocated for spoken language as the primary mode of communication for the deaf. So, the sentence means that despite some positive developments, there were significant challenges and setbacks faced by sign language and the deaf community during this period.

In the context of the sentence you provided, it suggests that sign languages were considered less important or less desirable compared to spoken language, resulting in their suppression or marginalization in favor of oralism.


#1094 Bird Legs
    One of the reasons why bird legs seem so thin is that their body is largely hidden by feathers, which can make them look much bigger than they really are. Birds have more muscular thighs that are _______ by their feathers, and most birds have scaly skin on their lower legs, which makes these parts look very small and bare. Birds that have feathers ______ to their toes — such as owls and some breeds of chickens — seem to have thicker calves than their featherless-legged relatives. But it’s not only a matter of perception: bird legs have some real differences from legs of other living animals. Birds are the descendants of theropod dinosaurs, a group of animals that walked on two legs and varied in size. _______ most mammals that can walk on two legs — such as bears, chimpanzees and humans—who stand on their heels, dinosaurs walked on their toes and the front part of the foot, with the rest of their foot bones stretched and lifted off the ________.

#1095 Satellite
    Satellite data shows that the Earth has increased its green leaf area by 5 percent in the last two decades, and the rate of greening is accelerating across more than half of its land. This phenomenon, known as “global greening”, might seem like good news for the environment, but it is not as simple as it ______. One of the main drivers of global greening is the rise of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, which _________ as a fertilizer for plants. However, this also means that the planet is warming up due to the greenhouse effect, which has many negative consequences for ecosystems and human well-being. Another driver is the expansion of agriculture and tree planting, especially in China and India, which _________ for one-third of all greening. While these activities can increase food production and forest cover, they also often replace native habitats, reduce biodiversity, and consume water and chemicals. __________, global greening is not a sign that nature is healing, but rather that humans are altering the environment on a planetary _________. The changing color of the Earth reflects the complex and sometimes contradictory impacts of human activities on the biosphere.

#1127 Nostradamus
    One of the most interesting and often cited wrong predictions attributed to Nostradamus ______ the year 1999. In one of his quatrains, Nostradamus predicted that in "the year 1999, in the seventh month, from the sky will come a great King of Terror" to bring back to life the "great King of the Mongols." Many interpreted this as a prophecy predicting a catastrophic event or the end of the world in July 1999, possibly a nuclear apocalypse or a _______ asteroid impact. However, July 1999 came and went without any such cataclysmic events. Critics and scholars argue that this prediction, like many of Nostradamus's quatrains, is vague and ________ to wide interpretation, which has led to numerous speculative and incorrect claims about his foresight into future events. This particular prophecy showcases the complexities and challenges in interpreting Nostradamus's work, ________ the human penchant for finding meaning in ambiguous predictions.

#68 Different Stories of Economy
    Here are a couple different stories you can tell about our economy. One goes like this. Eight years after the _______ economic crisis of our lifetimes, our economy has created jobs for 71 straight months. That’s a new record. _____ has fallen below five percent. Last year, the ________ household saw its income grow by about twenty-eight hundred dollars – the biggest one-year increase ever. And the ________ rate is at an all-time low. All that is true. What's also true is that too much of our wealth is still taken by the top and that leaves too many families still working paycheck to paycheck, without a lot of _______ room. There are two things we can do about this. We can prey on people's worries for _______ gain. Or we can actually do something to help working families feel more secure in today's economy. Count me in the ________ camp. And here's one thing that will help right away: making sure more of our families have access to paid leave. Today, having both parents in the workforce is an economic __________ for many families. But right now, millions of Americans don't have access to even a single day of paid sick leave.

#67 Investment 
    When the time comes, its peers should follow suit. Of these, the European Central Bank faces the trickiest ________, because it has acted as, in effect, the backstop to euro-zone bond markets, a _______ that otherwise the currency bloc still lacks. But the main safety valve lies elsewhere, with banks and investors. Bitter experience has shown that debt-funded assets can _______ losses, causing financial crises. For this reason banks must be able to withstand any reversal of today's high asset prices and low defaults. That means raising bank capital in places where it is too low, ______ the euro zone, and not backsliding on strenuous “stress tests” as America's Treasury proposes. In the end, however, there may be no escape for investors from the low future returns and even losses that high asset prices imply. They and ______ should take a leaf out of “The ______ Investor”, and make sure that they have a margin of safety.

#1142 Wikipedia
    Wikipedia, crafted by ordinary folks like Diana, who's penned extensively on World War II and P Diddy, exemplifies the democratization of information. The guidelines, while stringent, occasionally allow personality to seep through, adding _______ to entries like the Pope Mobile. However, Wikipedia is not without its imperfections. Misinformation, though often short-lived thanks to vigilant editors, can sometimes persist. Yet, it's remarkable that studies have found it to be more accurate than traditional encyclopedias like Britannica. This speaks volumes about the collective effort of its contributors to maintain the integrity of this vast knowledge ________. It's a living document, constantly evolving with contributions from _______ the globe. Whether it's minor edits or combating misinformation, every contribution enriches this knowledge repository. Debates over minutiae, like the capitalization in "Star Trek Into Darkness," might seem trivial but reflect the deep ________ invested in preserving knowledge integrity. Wikipedia is not just about _______ facts; it's about curating history in real-time, a collective endeavor that's both fascinating and crucial in an era of information overload.

Beyond their charming appearance, roly-polies contribute to the health of garden soil through their feeding habits. They primarily feed on decaying plant material, _________ it down into smaller particles that can decompose more rapidly. This process accelerates the composting process, transforming organic waste into nutrient-rich soil that can benefit garden plants. Additionally, as roly-polies _________ plant material, they excrete waste that is rich in nitrogen, an essential nutrient for plant growth. This natural recycling of nutrients ensures a continuous supply of essential elements for the garden ecosystem. Hence, encouraging a healthy population of roly-poly bugs in the garden can enhance composting efforts and contribute to the overall _______ of the garden environment.

The "assoc" in association got snipped and slapped with an "er," giving ______ to "soccer." It stuck around, especially in places like the United States and Australia, where they already had their own _______ of football. So, while most of the world passionately calls it "football," Americans and a few others _______ on to "soccer" to avoid confusion with their own gridiron and Aussie rules games.

The importance of writing theater plays and discussing ancient writings has become an integral part of the rising debate in the present world. While proponents of the argument are in favor, however, the opponents are completely against the relevance of teaching these subjects to high school students. In my opinion, writing theater play has more positive impacts than negatives around the globe.

To begin with, there are several factors in favor of my belief. The most prominent reason is that theater play helps students to learn public speaking skills which is very important in building a successful career. According to the research conducted by Western Sydney University, successful scholars and businessmen have great public speaking skills and they learned it by writing theater plays. Secondly, discussing ancient writings bring the curiosity to learn history, which enables an individual to learn from other's mistake and help to build a successful life.

On the other hand, critics may point out that one of the most significant disadvantages is that the modern world demands skills of computing to survive in the competitive world. For instance, a survey conducted in the United States reveals that four out of five published job vacancies in the job seeking portal expect the candidate to have a good expertise in computer.

In conclusion, even when there are a lot of demerits associated with high school students learning to write theater plays and discuss ancient writings, the advantages outweigh the diasdvantages, and learning to write theater play has become a crucial part of our lives. Therefore, efficient use of writings should be promoted. However, its misuse should be condemned.

# Essay 

Do you think that ocean exploration is as important as space exploration?

    mine 
        The importance of ocean exploration over space exploration has become an integral part of the rising debate in the present world. While proponents of the argument are in favor, however, the opponents are completely against the relevance of ocean exploration. In my opinion, the ocean exploration has more positive impacts than negatives around the globe.

        To begin with, there are several factors in favor of my belief. The most prominent reason is that seventy percent of earth is covered by ocean. Therefore it's essential to explore and understand what's in it. According to the research conducted by Western Sydney University, over fifty percent of marine species live in ocean are not discovered yet. Secondly, as human rely on ocean for several needs, it's always beneficial to deeply understand the strengths and weekness of the sea for sustainability.

        On the other hand, critics may point out that one of the most significant disadvantages is that the risk of pollution and global warming. For instance, a survey conducted in the United States reveals that the ocea exploration significantly contribute to the pollution of water sources.

        In conclusion, even when there a lot of demerits associated with ocean exploration, the advantages outweigh the disadvantages and the ocean exploration has become a crucial part of our lives. Therefore the efficient use of ocean exploration should be promoted. However, its misuse should be condemned.

        The importance of cashless transactions over traditional money has become an integral part of the rising debate in the present world. While proponents of the argument are in favor, however, the opponents are completely against the relevance of cashless transactions. In my opinion, the topic has more positive impacts than negatives around the globe.

        To begin with, there are several factors in favor of my belief. The most prominent reason is that the cashless transactions provide a visibility and transparency for the government to assess the amount of transactions. According to the research conducted by Western Sydney University, eighty percent of scholars agree that promoting cashless transactions is the only way to get more accurate tax income which leads to the prosperity of the nation. Secondly, consumers and businesses started to realize that the cashless transactions are ease and effortless comparing to handling cash providing balance and carrying them around.

        On the other hand, critics may point out that one of the most significant disadvantages is that the cashless transactions motivate cyber criminals to do illegal activities and prey on victims. For instance, a survey conducted in the United States reveals that the youngsters in their early ages get motivated by cyber crimes and they consider it as a lucarative job.

        In conclusion, even when there are a lot of demerits associated with cashless transactions, the advantages outweigh the disadvantages and cashless transactions has become a crucial part of our lives. Therefore, the efficient use of cashless transactions should be promoted. However, its misuse should be condemned.

01. Intelligence Comparison
    https://www.apeuni.com/en/practice/fib_wr/3

    Comparing the intelligence of animals of different species is difficult, how do you compare a dolphin and a horse? Psychologists have a technique for looking at intelligence that _________ not require the cooperation of the animal involved. The relative size of an individual's brain is a reasonable indication of intelligence. Comparing __________ species is not as simple as generally expected. An elephant will have a larger brain than a human has simply because it is a large beast. ________, we use the Cephalization index, which compares the size of an animal's brain with the size of its body. Based on the Cephalization index, the brightest animals on the planet are humans, ________ by great apes, porpoises and elephants. As a general _________, animals that hunt for a living (like canines) are smarter than strict vegetarians (you don't need much intelligence to outsmart a leaf of lettuce). Animals that live in social groups are always smarter and have larger EQ's than solitary animals.

            "Intercede" implies intervening on behalf of someone, 
                which is not appropriate in the context of discussing reasons for moving.
            "Intersperse" means to scatter or distribute among other things,

            is used to describe a past event or situation 
            that occurred before the present moment. 
        "Has had" is the correct choice because it indicates that someone has already had the opportunity to study the languages, 
            and this action took place in the past relative to the current context.

        The options 
            "would have," "have," and "having had" would not be as suitable in this context:
        "Would have" is used to express a hypothetical or unreal situation in the past, which doesn't fit the intended meaning here.
        "Have" alone would imply a present action rather than a past one, and it wouldn't convey the sense of something happening before the current moment.
        "Having had" is a present perfect participle, and it would imply an ongoing action or a recent completion, which is not the intended meaning in this case.



05. Southern Cone

    In the southern cone especially, from Venezuela to Argentina, the region is rising to overthrow the legacy of external domination of the past centuries and the cruel and destructive social forms that they have helped to establish. The ________ of imperial control — violence and economic warfare, hardly a distant memory in Latin America — are losing their effectiveness, a sign of the shift toward independence. Washington is now compelled to tolerate governments that in the past would have drawn intervention or reprisal. Throughout the region a vibrant _______ of popular movements provides the basis for a meaningful democracy. The indigenous populations, as if in a rediscovery of their pre-Columbian legacy, are much more active and influential, particularly in Bolivia and Ecuador. These developments are in part the result of a phenomenon that has been observed for some years in Latin America: As the elected governments become more formally democratic, citizens ________ an increasing disillusionment with democratic institutions. They have sought to construct democratic systems based on popular participation rather than elite and foreign ________.

    Three degrees does not sound like much but it _________ a rise in temperature compatible with the global heating that occurred between the last ice age, some 15,000 years ago, and the warmth of the eighteenth century. When Earth was cold, giant glaciers sometimes extended from the polar-regions as far south as St Louis in the US and the Alps in Europe. Later this century when it is three degree hotter glaciers everywhere will be melting in a climate of often __________ heat and drought, punctuated with storms and floods. The _________ for humanity could be truly horrific; if we fail to act swiftly, the full impact of global heating could cull us along with vast populations of the plant and animals with whom we share Earth. In a worst-case scenario, there might - in the 22nd century - be only a remnant of humanity eking out a ________ existence in the polar-regions and the few remaining oases left on a hot and arid Earth.

For example, the strain currently in the Americas and another previously detected in French Polynesia are practically _________ from each other (group in white box). If the virus has changed so little over time, why is it rearing its ugly head now? Scientists are not sure yet, but new experimental work in mosquitoes suggests that the virus was capable of ________ detrimental health effects and outbreaks all along. Therefore, it is unlikely mutations enabled new abilities. Instead, public health officials probably did not understand Zika's potential because the virus ___________ mostly in remote locations until recently.

Restaurant owner Andrew Iredale could hardly be described as a zealous revolutionary. He certainly doesn’t look like one. But he has introduced a radical shake-up in the way that his eatery welcomes autism-affected families—one in which campaigners hope other restaurateurs will now follow suit. As the father of Josh, an eight-year-old boy with autism, Andrew knows full well that for parents who have children with learning difficulties, going out for a meal can often turn out to be stressful and embarrassing. “Going out to a restaurant should be an enjoyable experience,” said Andrew, who runs Seasons Restaurant in downtown Leamington Spa, an English tourist town with a population of 58,000, which is located in Shakespeare’s County of Warwickshire. “And I mean enjoyable for everyone—there should be no exceptions.” That’s why Andrew, who co-owns the restaurant with his mother, Pamela, has introduced special “quality time” dining for those with learning difficulties so they can appreciate the pleasure of eating out in a safe environment. “Many families who have children with learning difficulties such as autism are put off from dining out because of the ‘strange looks’ that are given to them by other customers. And it is a fact that some diners are disturbed when they see youngsters having outbursts or simply refusing to sit still. “There’s no doubt that raising an autistic child is a challenge. It’s not helped when people mistake such behaviour as being that of someone who appears just to be very naughty—and it’s not easy for parents to ignore the stares and comments of others when ‘all eyes are on them.’ “Admittedly, most people are more understanding and tolerant if the situation is explained to them, but an uncomfortable feeling can still remain,” said Andrew. “However, we believe there is no reason why families with learning difficulties should be excluded from such an enjoyable social experience as dining out. That’s why, on the first and third Friday of the month, from 5pm until 7 o-clock, we now provide an ‘early meal option’ for just such families.”
What are the true facts from the above passage?
Restaurants designed for autistic children are found in every street of Warwickshire.

The main motive for the restaurant was to allow family with autistic children to come over in order to make the experience less stressful and less embarrassing.

It gets a little awkward for other customers when they come across with queer looks from children.

There is a fixed schedule for families with autistic children for dining out at Andrew’s restaurant.

Pamela was the first one to decide or open up a new venture targeting the disabled children.

Pamela has a grandson with autism.

Just by looking at images of Earth from space, it's clear that the ocean is a significant piece of the Earth's story. In fact, the ocean represents over 70% of the Earth's surface and contains 97% of all water on Earth. The ocean stores heat like a "fly wheel" for climate. Its huge capacity as a heat and water reservoir moderates the climate of Earth. Within this Earth system, both the physical and biological processes of the ocean play a key role in the water cycle, the carbon cycle, and climate variability. Even if you live nowhere near the ocean, you will still experience the ocean's influence in our Earth system.
What point is the writer making in this paragraph?
The ocean plays a vital role in life on earth.

The ocean is only a minor part of the life cycle on earth.

The ocean only influences the lives of people living near it.

The ocean plays no part in the earth's climate.

Last year, astronomers observed two neutron stars collide. A crash 
transmitted
 in gravitational waves to detectors here on Earth. Represented in sound, you can hear a small upwards sweep in frequency, in the data, if you listen closely. Several seconds later, the first waves of electromagnetic radiation arrived here on Earth - the first time a collision has been detected by both light and gravitational waves. And it's in studying the electromagnetic 
echoes
 of the collision that astrophysicists have gotten a far better 
glimpse
 of what really happened after those binary neutron stars merged, 130 million light years away. "Oh yeah, absolutely, so it gives us an understanding of 
basically
 all the nitty-gritty of what's going on after the merger takes place." Kunal Mooley, an astrophysicist at Caltech. First, he says, the stars collided, creating a massive, black hole_like object, which started sucking up the cloud of neutron-rich cosmic debris left over from the crash. But its 
appetite
 was limited. "It cannot eat all of it, so some bit of it basically escapes." Those escaping leftovers spewed outward into space, as a powerful jet. But along the way, Mooley says, the jet appears to have interacted with that cloud of neutron-rich material, blowing up a sort of cocoon within the debris 
floating
 around the collision. Until finally, the jet burst out and slammed into interstellar space releasing yet more radiation we could detect here on Earth.


Finally, we take a look at how to mix and unmix 
liquids
 at the flick of a switch. Sandrine tells us more. Oil and water don't usually mix, but the new chemical sensitive to light has been added here to 
blend
 them together. When 
exposed
 to UV light, the chemical changes its structure and become soluble in water. This causes two layers to form with the oil floating on top of the water chemical combo. This method should be cheaper than the current 
alternative
 which involves using high energy centrifuges.

While proponents of the argument are in favor, however, the opponents are completely against the relevance of the ethical concerns related to the artificial intelligence. In my opinion, the rise of artificial intelligence has more positive impacts than negatives around the globe.

To begin with, there are several factors in favor of my belief. The most prominent one is that the artificial intelligence is revolutionizing medical industry by providing more accurate predictions which leads to better patient outcome. According to the research conducted by Western Sydney University, out of one thousand predictions more than nine hundred predictions are way more accurate than what doctors predict. Secondly, as the data provided to artificial intelligence is anonymised, there is no concern of privacy and it's completely safe.

The rise of artificial intelligence (AI) has become an integral part of the rising debate in the present world. While proponents of the argument are in favor, asserting the positive impacts it can have on efficiency and innovation, opponents are completely against the relevance of artificial intelligence. In my opinion, artificial intelligence has more positive impacts than negatives around the globe.

To begin with, there are several factors in favor of my belief. The most prominent one is that AI enhances productivity and efficiency in various sectors. For example, automation powered by AI can streamline complex processes, leading to increased output and cost-effectiveness. According to the research conducted by Western Sydney University, the implementation of AI technologies has shown significant improvements in manufacturing processes, optimizing resource utilization and reducing waste. Secondly, AI has the potential to revolutionize healthcare by enabling faster and more accurate diagnostics, ultimately saving lives and improving patient outcomes.

On the other hand, critics may point out that one of the most significant disadvantages is the potential for job displacement due to automation. For instance, a survey conducted in the United States reveals that a considerable percentage of workers express concerns about AI technologies rendering their jobs obsolete. However, historical precedent suggests that technological advancements have typically led to the creation of new job opportunities, and the responsible implementation of AI can follow a similar trajectory.

In conclusion, even when there are a lot of demerits associated with artificial intelligence, the advantages outweigh the disadvantages, and AI has become a crucial part of our lives. Therefore, the efficient use of artificial intelligence should be promoted. However, its misuse should be condemned. Striking a balance between embracing technological progress and addressing ethical considerations is crucial for ensuring that artificial intelligence is developed and deployed responsibly.

A healthy diet is more important for keeping fit than exercise. To what extent do you agree with this statement? Give example or personal experiences.

* Mine 

The importance of healthy diet has become an integral part of the rising debate in the present world. While proponents of the argument are in favor, however, the opponents are completel against the relevance of healthy diet for keeping fit. In my opinion, the focusing on consuming healthy diet has more importance than exercising in order to stay fit. 

To begin with, there are several factors in favor of my belief. The most prominent reason is that the right food is the base of physical fitness because the body demands nutrition which can be obtained only via the meals we consume. According to the research conducted by Western Sydney University, a considerable percentage of participants who were consuming healthy meals regularly continued to stay fit, even they were not doing workouts regularly. Secondly, fitness enthusiasts keep emphasizing the importance of healthy diet as it lays the foundation to build a strong body by providing the nutritions. 

On the other hand, critics may point out that one of the significant disadvantages is food addiction. For instance, a survey conducted in the United States reveals that the people who wanted to consume healthy diet eventually got carried away and started eating plenty of junk foods. As they had deprioritized the exercise already they ended up putting up weight and became unhealthy.

The importance of a healthy diet has become an integral part of the rising debate in the present world. While proponents of the argument are in favor, however, the opponents are completely against the relevance of a healthy diet for keeping fit. In my opinion, focusing on consuming a healthy diet is more important than exercising in order to stay fit. 

To begin with, there are several factors in favor of my belief. The most prominent reason is that the right food is the base of physical fitness because the body demands nutrition which can be obtained only via the meals we consume. According to the research conducted by Western Sydney University, a considerable percentage of participants who were consuming healthy meals regularly continued to stay fit, even if they were not doing workouts regularly. Secondly, fitness enthusiasts keep emphasizing the importance of a healthy diet as it lays the foundation to build a strong body by providing nutrition. 

On the other hand, critics may point out that one of the significant disadvantages is food addiction. For instance, a survey conducted in the United States reveals that the people who wanted to consume a healthy diet eventually got carried away and started eating plenty of junk foods. As they had deprioritized the exercise already they ended up putting up weight and became unhealthy.

In conclusion, even when there are a lot of demerits associated with the importance of healthy diets, the advantages outweigh the disadvantages and a healthy diet with balanced nutrition has become a crucial part of our lives. Therefore, the right approach to consuming a healthy diet should be promoted. However, its misuse should be condemned.

Title: The Importance of a Healthy Diet in Fitness

The role of a healthy diet in maintaining fitness has become an integral part of the rising debate in the present world. 
While proponents of the argument are in favor, opponents are completely against the relevance of the healthy diet. 
In my opinion, a healthy diet has more positive impacts than negatives around the globe.

To begin with, there are several factors in favor of my belief. 
The most prominent one is that a nutritious diet is fundamental to weight management, a cornerstone of physical fitness. 
Consuming balanced meals with the right mix of nutrients aids in controlling caloric intake, influencing weight more significantly than exercise alone. 
According to the research conducted by Western Sydney University, 
individuals who prioritize dietary modifications experience more substantial weight loss compared to those relying solely on exercise.
Secondly, a healthy diet is essential for overall health, providing the body with vital vitamins and minerals that contribute to optimal functioning.

On the other hand, critics may point out that one of the most significant disadvantages is that 
adhering to a healthy diet can be challenging in the face of modern, fast-paced lifestyles. 
For instance, a survey conducted in the United States reveals that 
the convenience and availability of processed foods often lead individuals to make unhealthy dietary choices.

In conclusion, even when there are challenges associated with maintaining a healthy diet, the advantages, including effective weight management and overall health, outweigh the disadvantages. 
A healthy diet has become a crucial part of our lives, and promoting its efficient use is essential for sustaining fitness. 
However, awareness and education are necessary to address challenges and prevent the misuse of dietary choices that may compromise overall well-being.

Jupiter has 2.5 times more mass than all the other planets of the solar system combined and is 11 times as large as Earth in diameter. Jupiter is so large that scientists believe it almost became a star: as the gasses and dust contracted to the form the planet, gravitational forces created tremendous pressure and the temperature inside the core—as high as tens of thousands of degrees. But there was not enough mass available to create the temperature needed to start a fusion reaction such as that of the Sun (above 27,000,000 Fahrenheit, or 15,000,000 Celsius, at the Sun's core); thus Jupiter has been cooling down ever since. Even so, Jupiter radiates about as much heat as it receives from the Sun.
The passage is mainly concerned with

the size of Jupiter relative to other planets in the solar system

differences between the sun and Jupiter

how Jupiter's mass has affected its development

the temperature at which a planet's core can start a fusion reaction

Since a further 21% of the Universe is made up from invisible ' Cold Dark Matter' that can only be _______ through its gravitational effects, the ordinary atomic matter making up the rest is apparently only 4% of the total cosmic budget. These ________ require a shift in our perception as great as that made after Copernicus' ________ that the Earth moves around the Sun. This lecture will start by reviewing the chequered history of Dark Energy, not only since Einstein's proposal for a similar entity in 1917, but by tracing the concept back to Newton's ideas.

For a start, we need to change our ________ of 'retirement', and we need to change mind-sets arising from earlier government policy which, in the face of high unemployment levels, encouraged mature workers to take early retirement. Today, government encourages them to __________ their retirement. We now need to think of retirement as a phased process, where mature age workers ________ reduce their hours, and where they have considerable flexibility in how they combine their work and non work time. We also need to recognise the broader change that is occurring in how people work, learn, and live. Increasingly we are moving away from a linear relationship between education, training, work, and retirement, as people move in and out of jobs, careers, caregiving, study, and leisure. Employers of choice remove the ________ between the different segments of people's lives, by creating flexible conditions of work and a range of leave entitlements. They take an individualised approach to workforce planning and development so that the needs of employers and employees can be met ___________. This approach supports the different transitions that occur across the life course - for example, school to work, becoming a parent, becoming responsible for the care of older relatives, and moving from work to retirement.

4. The Amount of Sleep
    https://www.apeuni.com/en/practice/fib_rd/137

The amount of sleep you need depends on many _______, especially your age. Newborns sleep between 16 and 18 hours a day and preschool children should sleep between 10 and 12 hours. Older children and teens need at least nine hours to be well rested. For most adults, seven to eight hours a night appears to the best amount of sleep. However, for some people" enough sleep" may be as few as five hours or as many as 10 hours of sleep. As you get older, your sleeping ________ change. Older adults tend to sleep more lightly and awaken more frequently in the night than younger adults. This can have many causes including medical conditions and medications used to treat them. But there’s no evidence that older adults need less sleep than younger adults. Getting enough sleep is ________ to your health because it boosts your _________ system, which makes your body better able to fight disease. Sleep is necessary for your nervous system to work properly. Too little sleep makes you drowsy and unable to concentrate. It also impairs memory and physical performance. So how many hours of sleep are enough for You? Experts say that if you feel drowsy during the day — even during boring activities - you are not getting enough sleep. Also, quality of sleep is just as important as quantity. People whose sleep is frequently interrupted or cut short are not getting quality sleep. If you experience frequent daytime sleepiness, even after increasing the amount of quality sleep you get, talk to your doctor. He or she may be able to __________ the cause of sleep problems and offer advice on how to get a better night’s sleep.

The late 1980's found the landscape of popular music in America dominated by a distinctive style of rock and roll known as Glam Rock or Hair Metal—so called because of the over-styled hair, makeup, and wardrobe worn by the genre's ostentatious rockers. Bands like Poison, White Snake, and Motley Crue popularized glam rock with their power ballads and ashy style, but the product had worn thin by the early 1990's. The mainstream public, tired of an act they perceived as symbolic of the superficial 1980's, was ready for something with a bit of substance.

However simple or complex the chain of events in any given situation, when looked into it usually reveals a train of 
causal
 relationships - they are seen to be 
linked
 in some way. The methods of analysis aim to establish these relationships and provide a solid background for useful 
generalizations
 based on what at first appear to be separate events. The first step in this process is to collect facts and then see if any particular 
patterns
 emerge. If they do, it then becomes possible to form theories related to the facts, and this type of empirical theory forms a useful basis for 
analysis
 and prediction. However, on its own this theory is not enough; the essential second step is to test it by collecting more facts and by checking predictions against events. These new facts may mean you have to 
modify
 the theory, bearing in mind that new facts can only either disprove or 
support
 a theory - they cannot prove it to be right.

Those of you who’ve never heard the term neo-Latin , may be forgiven for thinking it’s a new South American dance craze. If you’re

confessed
 they are not really sure what it is either. Some have 
assumed
 that they are socalled 'Late-Latin', written at the end of the Roman Empire. Others have supposed it must have something to do with the middle ages. Or perhaps it’s that 
pseudo-latin
 which my five and seven-year-old boys seem to have 
gleaned
 from the Harry Potter books, useful for spells and curses that they zip one another with makeshift paper ash ones. No, in fact, neo-latin is more or less the same as the Latin that was written in the

Psychology, a study of human mind and behaviour, deals with several types of disorders. There are in total eight categories of disorders connected with childhood and family and, of course, with personality.

Earlier there was a notion that psychology deals with souls and spirits. The notion has been dispelled now and it is commonly accepted that psychology is a study of human behaviour.

Psychology is not so much a study of mind and certainly not of the spirit, as it is of behaviour. It studies several types of disorders in human behaviour as depression, anxiety, personality and other such disorders.

Psychology and soul have not much in common, nor have psychology and mind. Psychology is a study of human disorders like behavioural and personality.

1. Owls 
    https://www.apeuni.com/en/practice/fib_wr/36

    Owls are nearly ________ hunters, swooping down on prey without any warning whoosh. How do they do it? We've known that the leading edge of an owl's wing has a comb of stiff _________. And the trailing edge has a flexible fringe, unlike the rigid trailing edge of a _________ bird wing. These two features contribute to a structure that ________ almost no noise as it rushes through the air. Now it appears that these ________ have a third trick up their sleeves — or rather, wings — that allow them to be so silent but deadly. Researchers modeled the effect of the layer of down on the wing's top surface. And it looks like that fluffy stuff absorbs sound too. The work was presented at a meeting of the American Physical Society's Division of Fluid Dynamics. Mimicking owl wing down may lead to new sound-proofing materials. Down and the other silencing features could inspire wind turbines and plane engines that produce less noise and fewer vibrations. So that all we hear is silence.

2. Paleoanthropologist
    https://www.apeuni.com/en/practice/fib_wr/135

    Forty years ago yesterday, November 24, 1974, paleoanthropologist Donald Johanson found in Ethiopia what's arguably the most famous and important fossil of a human ________: Lucy. Last month, at the ScienceWriters2014 meeting in Columbus, Ohio, Johanson talked about the moment he laid eyes on Lucy. "On that eventful day in 1974 I was out, with a graduate student, Tom Gray, and we were walking back to our Land Rover to go back to camp to enjoy a swim in the river with the crocodiles and enjoy a nice little lunch. And I am always looking at the ground. I find more quarters by parking meters than anybody I know, I think. And you know how it is you find what you're looking for, right? "Because a year before the ______________ a geologist had left his footprints four-to-five feet away from the ___________, because he was looking for rocks. I was looking for bones. And I found a little piece of elbow, that little ______________ that allows us to flex and extend our arm. And I knew from my studies of osteology, of comparative anatomy and so on, that this had to be from a human ancestor. "And as I looked up the slope, I saw other ___________ eroding out. And we recovered over a two-week-long excavation operation roughly, not counting hand and foot bones, 40 percent of a ske barrier. All the fossils older than three million years at that point in the history oleton. And this was important because first of all it broke the three-million-year timef paleoanthropology would fit in the palm of your hand… we didn't know it was a new species really until a few years later when we finally _____________ in 1978 the name Australopithecus afarensis." For more, check out the blog item on our Web site by Scientific American's Kate Wong who, with Johanson, co-authored the book Lucy's Legacy.

3.  Clown Fish
    https://www.apeuni.com/en/practice/fib_wr/33

    Clown fish became famous thanks to the movie Finding Nemo. In real life, their social hierarchy is simple: larger fish dominate their smaller ________. Now we know that to reinforce this social structure, the fish communicate with aggressive and submissive audio signals. The new info is in the journal PLoS ONE. Researchers ______ clown fish calls, ________ this noise as one chased a smaller fish. These popping sounds function as an aggression signal. When a clown fish has been chased and wishes to submit, it shakes its head in a submissive gesture and produces clicking noises like these. The researchers _________ the aggressive and submissive calls, and found that the sound pulses in a submissive signal were shorter and more high-pitched. Unlike many animals that use sound to draw in _________ mates, clown fish appear to use their calls only as labels of social status. When a little fish makes submissive sounds to a larger one, neither has to invest in a physical confrontation. Which is good news for small-fry like Nemo.

Despite its name, though Burger King has fallen short of _______ the burger crown, unable to surpass market leader McDonald's No. 1 sales status. Always the bridesmaid and never the bride, Burger King remains No 2. Worse yet, Burger King has experienced a six-year 22 percent decline in customer traffic, with its overall quality rating dropping while ratings for the other three _______ have increased. The decline has been ________ to inconsistent product quality and poor customer service. Although the chain tends to throw advertising dollars at the problem, an understanding of Integrated Marketing Communication theory would suggest that internal management problems (nineteen CEOs in fifty years) need to be ________ before a unified, long-term strategy can be put in place. The _________ of consistency in brand image and messages, at all levels of communication, has become a basic tenet of IMC theory and practice. The person who takes the customer's order must communicate the same message as Burger King's famous tagline, 'Have it your way,' or the customer will just buzz up the highway to a chain restaurant that seems more consistent and, therefore, more ___________.

The finding runs __________ to the ____________ that Amazonian diversity is the ____________ of evolution only within the tropical forest itself. " Basically, the Amazon basin is 'melting pot' for South American frogs," says graduate student Juan Santos, lead author of the study. "Poison frogs there have come from multiple places of ___________, notably the Andes Mountains, over many millions of years. We have shown that you cannot understand Amazonian biodiversity by looking only in the basin. Adjacent regions have played a major role."

        -  The word "reservoirs" is chosen in the context of biological diversity to convey the idea of a vast and varied collection or supply of genetic material. 
        Here's why "reservoirs" is preferred over the other options:

        Reservoirs of Biological Diversity: In the context of ecosystems and biodiversity, the term "reservoirs" is commonly used to describe regions or areas that harbor a diverse range of species and genetic material. It implies a richness and abundance of biodiversity.

        Metaphor for Accumulation: The term "reservoirs" metaphorically suggests a large, accumulated supply of biological diversity, which aligns well with the idea that the Andes Mountains have been a significant source of diverse genetic material for the Amazon basin.

        Scale and Importance: "Reservoirs" implies a large-scale and important source of diversity. It suggests that the Andes Mountains have not only contributed to the Amazon's biodiversity but have done so in a substantial and essential way.

        While words like "pool," "tank," or "territories" might convey certain aspects of accumulation or abundance, "reservoirs" is often more closely associated with the concept of a significant and rich source of biological diversity, making it a fitting choice in this context.

1.  Social Isolation

    Sound depressing, even apocalyptic? Well, it could be the future. If government ______ are right, about 20 years from now, two out of five households will be single _______. And there is evidence the situation is already _______ . According to a report, Social Isolation in America, published in the American Sociological Review in 2006, the average American today has only two close friends. Twenty-five per cent of those surveyed said they do not have anyone to talk with about important things—And yet, while some are _________ a crisis in our ability to make friends, others are saying exactly the opposite. For example, MSN's Anatomy of Friendship Report, published last November, suggests that the average Briton has 54 friends—a __________ rise of 64 per cent since 2003.

2.  Hans Christian Andersen
    https://www.apeuni.com/en/practice/fib_wr/572

    Fans of biographical criticism have a luxurious source in the works of Hans Christian Andersen. Like Lewis Carroll (and, to a lesser extent, Kenneth Grahame), Andersen was near- pathologically uncomfortable in the company of adults. Of course, all three had to work and _______ with adults, but all three really ________ well to children and their simpler worlds. Andersen, for a time, ran a puppet theater and was incredibly popular with children, and, of course, he wrote an impressive body of fairy tales which have been produced in thousands of editions since the 19th century. Most everyone has read or at least knows the titles of many of Andersen’s works: “The Ugly Duckling,” “The Emperor’s New Clothes,” “The Nightingale,” “The Little Mermaid,” “The Match Girl,” and many others. Though, as with most folk and fairy tales, they ________ adult rereaders much differently than they do young first-time readers. Charming tales of ducks who feel _________ because they don’t fit in, only to exult in the discovery that they are majestic swans, gives child readers clearly-identifiable messages: don’t tease people because they’re different; don’t fret about your being different because some day you’ll discover what special _________ you have. A closer, deeper look at many of Andersen’s tales (including “The Ugly Duckling,” which is not on our reading list), reveals a darker, harder, more ___________ thread. People are often cruel and unfeeling, love is torturous–in general, the things of the material world cause suffering. There is often a happy ending, but it’s not conventionally happy. Characters are rewarded, but only after they manage (often through death) to transcend the rigors of the mortal world.

3.  Granular Material
    https://www.apeuni.com/en/practice/fib_wr/655

    Part of the fun of experimenting with granular materials, says Stephen W. Morris, is the showmanship. In one stunt that he has demonstrated in settings ranging from high school classrooms to television studios, the University of Toronto ________ loads clear plastic tubes with white table salt and black sand and starts them rotating. What transpires in the tubes usually knocks the socks off of any ________ bystander. Instead of mixing into a drab gray sameness, the sand particles slowly separate into crisp black bands cutting across a long, narrow field of salt. As the spinning continues, some bands disappear and new ones arise. "It's a parlor trick," Morris says. Not to deny its entertainment value, this __________ of how strangely granular materials can behave is also an authentic experiment in a field both rich in fundamental physics and major practical consequences.

If you don’t turn up to class you’re missing out on the whole ________ of the _______: you don’t think a whole lot, you don’t ________ in debates with other students - or with your teachers.” It is not all gloom, said Professor John Dearn, a Province-Chancellor at the University of Canberra, who said the Internet was ________ the way students access and use information. “It is strange that despite all the evidence as to their ineffectiveness, _______ lectures seem to persist in our universities.”

5.  Population Change
    https://www.apeuni.com/en/practice/fib_wr/724

    Populations can change through three processes: fertility, mortality and migration. Fertility ________ the number of children that women ________ and differs from fecundity (a woman's childbearing potential). Mortality is the study of the causes, consequences and measurement of processes affecting death in a population. Demographers most commonly study mortality using the Life Table, a statistical __________ which provides information about the mortality conditions (most notably the life expectancy) in the population. Migration refers to the movement of persons from an origin place to a destination place across some pre-defined political boundary. Migration researchers do not designate movements as migrations, _________ they are somewhat permanent. Thus demographers do not consider tourists and travelers to be migrating. While demographers who study migration typically do so through census data on place of _________, indirect sources of data including tax forms and labor force surveys are also important. Demography is today widely taught in many universities across the world, ________ students with initial training in social sciences, statistics or health studies.

6.  Seatbelt
    https://www.apeuni.com/en/practice/fib_wr/634

    I am a cyclist and a motorist. I fasten my seatbelt when I drive and wear a helmet on my bike to reduce the risk of injury. I am convinced that these are prudent safety measures. I have persuaded many friends to wear helmets on the grounds that transplant surgeons call those without helmets, "donors on wheels". But a book on ‘Risk' by my colleague John Adams has made me re-examine my deeply held ________. Adams has completely ________ my confidence in these apparently sensible precautions. What he has persuasively argued, particularly in relation to seat belts, is that the evidence that they do what they are supposed to do is very suspect. This is ________ numerous claims that seat belts save many thousands of lives every year. There is remarkable data on the years 1970 and 1978 in which countries where seat belts are ________ have had on average about 5 per cent more road accident deaths following the introduction of the law. In the UK, road deaths have decreased steadily from about 7,000 a year in 1972 to just over 4,000 in 1989. There is no evidence in the trend for any effect of the seat belt law that was introduced in 1983. Moreover, there is evidence that the number of cyclists and pedestrians killed actually increased by about 10 per cent.

    About 10,000 years ago, people learned how to make cloth. Wool, cotton, flax, or hemp was first spun into a thin thread using a spindle. The thread was then woven into a fabric. The earliest weaving machines _______ consisted of little more than a pair of sticks that held a set of parallel threads, called the warp, while the cross-thread, called the weft, was inserted. Later machines called looms had rods that separated the threads to allow the weft to be inserted more ________. A piece of wood, called the shuttle, holding a spool of thread, was passed between the separated threads. The basic __________ of spinning and weaving have stayed the same until the present day, though during the industrial revolution of the 18th century many ways were found of _________ the processes. With new machines such as the spinning mule, many threads could be spun at the same time, and, with the help of devices like the flying shuttle, broad pieces of cloth could be woven at great speed.

Ocean Floor 
    https://www.apeuni.com/en/practice/fib_wr/552
    :
    The ocean floor is home to many unique communities of plants and animals. Most of these marine ecosystems are near the water surface, such as the Great Barrier Reef, a 2,000-km long coral ______ off the northeastern coast of Australia. Coral reefs, like nearly all complex living communities, depend on solar energy for growth (photosynthesis). The sun's energy, however, penetrates at most only about 300 m below the surface of the water. The relatively shallow penetration of solar energy and the sinking of cold, subpolar water combine to make most of the deep ocean floor a _______ environment with few life forms. In 1977, scientists discovered hot springs at a depth of 2.5 km, on the Galapagos Rift (spreading ridge) off the coast of Ecuador. This exciting discovery was not really ______.Since the early 1970s, scientists had predicted that hot springs (geothermal vents) should be found at the active spreading centers along the mid-oceanic ridges, where magma, at temperatures over 1,000° Presumably was being erupted to form new oceanic crust. More exciting, because it was totally _________,was the discovery of abundant and unusual sea life - giant tube worms, huge clams, and mussels - that _______ around the hot springs.

    Jean Piaget, the pioneering Swiss philosopher and psychologist, spent much of his professional life listening to children, watching children and poring _____ reports of researchers around the world who were doing the same. He found, to put it most succinctly ,that children don't think like grownups. After thousands of interactions with young people often barely old enough to talk, Piaget began to _______ that behind their cute and seemingly illogical _____ were thought processes that had their own kind of order and their own special logic. Einstein called it a ______ "so simple that only a genius could have thought of it." Piaget's insight opened a new window into the inner workings of the mind. By the end of a wide-ranging and remarkably _______ research career that spanned nearly 75 years, from his first scientific publication at age 10 to work still in progress when he died at 84, Piaget had developed several new fields of science: developmental psychology, cognitive theory and what came to be called genetic epistemology. Although not an educational reformer, he ______ a way of thinking about children that provided the foundation for today’s education-reform _____. It was a shift comparable to the displacement of stories of "noble savages" and "cannibals" by modern anthropology. One might say that Piaget was the first to take children's thinking seriously.

Since Malaysia is one of the most pleasant, hassle-free countries to visit in Southeast Asia, any tourist itinerary would have to begin in the capital, Kuala Lumpur, where you will find the Petronas Twin Towers, which once comprised the world tallest buildings and now hold the title of second-tallest, and you can also climb Mount Kinabalu, the tallest peak in outheast Asia, visit the Sepilok Orang Utan Sanctuary, go white-water rafting.

    This is the first study to show that the Andes have been a major (2………….) of diversity for the Amazon basin, one of the largest (3……………..) of biological diversity on Earth. The finding runs (4……………) to the idea that Amazonian diversity is the result of evolution only within the tropical forest itself.

    “Basically, the Amazon basin is a ‘melting pot’ for South American frogs,” says graduate student Juan Santos, lead author of the study. “Poison frogs there have come from multiple places of (5…………….), notably the Andes Mountains, over many millions of years. We have shown that you cannot understand Amazonian biodiversity by looking only in the basin. Adjacent regions have played a major role.”

    Opportunity cost incorporates the notion of scarcity: No matter what we do, there is always a trade-off. We must trade off one thing for another because resources are limited and can be used in different ways. _By acquiring something_, we use up resources that could have been used to acquire something else. The _notion_ of opportunity cost allows us to measure this tradeoff.

Ozone

    Clones of an Eastern cottonwood ( Populus deltoides) in the Bronx and other city spots grew to double the biomass of clones ______ outside small towns upstate or on Long Island, says Jillian Gregg, now of the Environmental Protection Agency's western-ecology division in Corvallis, Ore. The growth gap comes from ______ damage, she and her New York colleagues report. Ozone chemists have known that _______ may spike skyscraper high in city air, but during a full 24 hours, rural trees actually get a higher cumulative ozone exposure from ______ pollution that blows in and lingers. A series of new experiments now shows that this hang-around ozone is the _______ factor in tree growth, the researchers say in the July 10 Nature. "This study has profound importance in showing us most vividly that rural areas ______ the price for urban pollution," says Stephen P. Long of the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. "This work should be a wake-up call," he adds.

Foreign policy 

    The foreign policy of a state, it is often argued, begins and ends with the border. No doubt an exaggeration, this aphorism nevertheless has an ______ of truth. A state's relation with its neighbors, at least in the _______ years, are greatly influenced by its frontier policy, especially when there are no ________ borders. Empire builders in the past sought to extend imperial frontiers for a variety of reasons; subjugation of kings and princes to gain their _________ (as well as handsome tributes or the coffers of the state), and, security of the core of the empire from external attacks by establishing a string of buffer states in areas ________ the frontiers. The history of British empire in India was no different. It is important to note in this connection that the concept of international boundaries (between two sovereign states), demarcated and _______, was yet to emerge in India under Mughal rule.

Film 

    Film is where art meets commerce. _______ Orson Welles said:"A painter just needs a brush and the writer just needs a pen, but the producer needs an army." And an army needs money. A producer is just like an entrepreneur, and we _raise_ money to make films. First, we need to find an original idea or a book or a play and purchase the rights, then we need money to develop that idea, often not a reasonably small sum.
    _______, to commission a writer for the screenplay isn't something you would want to gamble your own money on, so you find a partner. We are lucky here in the UK, as we have Film 4, BBC Films and the UK Film Council, all of ________ are good places to develop an idea. Producing in Britain is very different to producing in America or _______ Europe because the economic dynamic is different.

    We are lucky here in the UK, as we have Film 4, BBC Films, and the UK Film Council, 
    all of ___which___ are good places to develop an idea.

        Them: 
            Using "them" would create a pronoun reference error because it doesn't properly refer to a specific antecedent in the previous sentence. "Them" is a pronoun for people or things, but it needs a clear antecedent. In this case, it's not clear what "them" would refer to.

        That: 
            While "that" is often used as a relative pronoun, in this context, "which" is more appropriate. "That" is restrictive and is used when the information is essential to the meaning of the sentence. "Which" is more common when introducing non-restrictive clauses that provide additional information but are not essential.

        Those: 
            Similar to "them," "those" creates a pronoun reference issue. 
            It doesn't have a clear antecedent in the previous sentence.

        Which: 
            This is the correct choice. "Which" is a relative pronoun that introduces non-restrictive clauses, providing additional information about the preceding noun (Film 4, BBC Films, and the UK Film Council). It is appropriate when the clause is extra information and can be set off by commas.

Language 

    Language comes so naturally to us that it is easy to forget what a strange and miraculous gift it is. All over the world members of our _______ fashion their breath into hisses and hums and squeaks and pops and listen to others do the _______. We do this, of course, not only because we like the sounds but because details of the sounds contain information about the ________ of the person making them. We, humans, are fitted with a means of _______ our ideas, in all their unfathomable vastness. When we listen to speech, we can be led to think thoughts that have never been thought before and that never would have ________ to us on our own.

    Species: 
        This term is used to refer to a specific biological category, and in this context, 
        it emphasizes the shared biological nature of humans across the world. 
        It is suitable because it conveys a sense of commonality based on our biological makeup.
    :
    fashion their breath into hisses and hums and squeaks and pops and listen to others do the same
        describes the diverse ways in which individuals across the world use their breath to produce various sounds, such as hisses, hums, squeaks, and pops. This suggests a broad range of vocal expressions and auditory experiences. Additionally, the statement implies that people not only create these sounds themselves but also pay attention to and appreciate the similar sounds made by others. It underscores the universality of human engagement with and appreciation for the expressive qualities of breath-related sounds.

        incapable of being fully explored or understood.
        "her grey eyes were dark with some unfathomable emotion"
    :
    occurred" 
        is the most fitting choice in the context of the sentence. 
        Let's compare it with the other options:
        "When we listen to speech, we can be led to think thoughts that have never been thought before and that never would have occurred to us on our own."

        Occurred:
            * thoughts occur            (not happen)
            This word is appropriate because it suggests the spontaneous or natural emergence of thoughts during the act of listening to speech. "Occurred" implies that these thoughts came into existence or happened in the mind without deliberate effort.
        Happened:
            "Happened" is a general term for something taking place, but in the context of the sentence, "occurred" provides a more specific nuance, emphasizing the occurrence of thoughts in response to speech.
        Appeared: 
            While "appeared" can be used to describe the emergence of thoughts, it might imply a more deliberate or visible manifestation. In the context of the sentence, the focus is on the thoughts arising naturally during the process of listening to speech.
        Risen: 
            While "risen" can be used metaphorically to describe the emergence of thoughts, it may carry connotations of intentional action or effort. In the context of the sentence, the emphasis is on the spontaneous nature of the thoughts.

        In summary, "occurred" is the most suitable choice as it precisely conveys the idea of thoughts spontaneously arising during the process of listening to speech, aligning well with the context of the sentence.

Australian Women Novelists

    In the literary world, it was an accepted assumption that the 1970s was a time of unprecedented growth in homegrown Australian fiction. 
    And everybody was reading and talking about books by young Australian women. 
    But it was _not until_ recently that a researcher was able to measure just how many novels were published in that decade, 
    and she found that _there had been_ a decline in novels by Australian writers overall, 
    but confirmed an increase in women's novels. 
    It is this sort of research - testing ideas about literary history - that _is becoming_ possible with the spread of 'Digital Humanities.' 
    The intersection of Humanities and digital technologies _is opening up_ opportunities 
    in the fields of literature, linguistics, history and language that ____________ without computational methods and 
    digitized resources to _bring_ information together in an accessible way.

        It implies that the sleep is deep, peaceful, and undisturbed. 
    Successfully: 
        The term "successfully" is not commonly used to describe sleep. 
        It is more commonly associated with achievements or accomplishments rather than the quality of rest.

Arbitration 
    Arbitration is a method of conflict resolution which, with more or less formalized mechanisms, occurs in many political and legal spheres. 
    There are two main _characteristics_ to arbitration. 
    The first is that it is a voluntary process under which two parties in conflict agree between themselves 
    to be _bound_ by the judgment of a third party which has no other authority over them; 
    the judgment, however, is not legally binding. 
    The second is that there is usually no clear body of _laws_ or set of rules that must apply; 
    the arbitrator is free, _subject_ to any prior agreement with the conflicting parties, 
    to decide on whatever basis of justice is deemed _suitable_.

    Arbitration 
        is a procedure in which a dispute is submitted, by agreement of the parties, 
        to one or more arbitrators who make a binding decision on the dispute.
    Characteristics: 
        The term "characteristics" is used to describe distinctive features or qualities that define or distinguish something
    Characters: 
        The term "characters" typically refers to individuals or entities in a narrative or story

Sound Speed     

    Within that 36,000 – 60,000 foot range, Mach 1 is about 661 mph. Because of the variation, it is possible for an airplane flying supersonic at high altitude to be slower than a subsonic flight at sea level. The transonic band (the 'sound barrier') extends from around Mach 0.8 — when the first supersonic shock waves ___________ the wing — to Mach 1.2, when the entire wing has gone supersonic.

    An airplane flying supersonic means 
        that the aircraft is traveling at a speed that exceeds the speed of sound in the surrounding air. 
        The speed of sound varies depending on factors like temperature and altitude,
        but at sea level and standard atmospheric conditions,
        it is approximately 761 miles per hour (1,225 kilometers per hour).

        When an airplane reaches or surpasses the speed of sound,
        it enters the realm of supersonic flight.
        This transition is often associated with a characteristic shock wave known as a sonic boom.
        The speed at which an airplane is flying is often expressed in terms of Mach number,
        where Mach 1 is the speed of sound.
        If an airplane is flying at Mach 2,
        for example, it is traveling at twice the speed of sound.

        Supersonic flight is typically achieved by military aircraft,
        some high-performance civilian jets, and experimental aircraft. 
        It comes with unique aerodynamic challenges and considerations due to the formation of shock waves and other effects associated with traveling at such high speeds.

Drama 

    I do not think I am twisting the usual meaning of drama if I define it as a presentation before spectators by performers who take on roles and who interact with each other to further a story or a text intended for such presentations. 
    This is intended as a _working_ definition simple enough to be recalled easily.

    Indeed, it is so simple that I should point out that it makes one or two _______ that are perhaps not immediately obvious. First, to say that performers "take on roles" leaves _________ the possibility that they are not within the roles to other performances as such alternative phrases as "performers in character" or "characters represented by actors" do not. To say that the performers "interact with each other" might seem _________, but is in fact important, for in traditional societies there are many performances in which different characters appear successively and simultaneously but, _________, do not interact. And I say "to further a story" because a progression of the story may not provide the structure of the performance.

        The definition is said to make "one or two distinctions.
        This implies that the definition includes certain specific differences or characteristics that set it apart. 
    open:
        The phrase "leaves open the possibility" suggests that there is room for interpretation or alternative approaches.

    unabated 
        without any reduction in intensity or strength.

Panic-stricken climate

    Second, the biggest early impact of global warming will be on the food supply, both locally and globally. When the global average temperature hits one and a half degrees hotter - and it will; the carbon dioxide already in the atmosphere _________ us to that much warming - some countries will no longer be able to feed their people. Others, further from the equator, will still have enough food for themselves, but none to _spare_.

        The word "commits" is used in this context to convey the idea 
        that the presence of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere guarantees or 
        is bound to lead to a certain level of global warming. 
        It implies a cause-and-effect relationship, indicating that the existing carbon dioxide has a decisive impact on the future temperature increase.

        In this context, "commits" suggests 
        a certain inevitability or commitment to a particular outcome. 
        The sentence is stating that the carbon dioxide already present in the atmosphere ensures that the global average temperature will rise by one and a half degrees.

# Summary 

About 120,000 types of protein molecules have yielded up their structures to science. That sounds a lot, but it isn't. The techniques, such as X-ray crystallography and nuclear-magnetic resonance (NMR), which are used to elucidate the structures as not yet work on all proteins. Some types are hard to produce or purify in the volumes required. Others do not seem to crystallize at all—a prerequisite for probing them with X-rays. As a consequence, those structures that have been determined include who are less than a third of the 16,000 known protein families. Researchers can build reasonable computer models for another third, because the structures of these resemble ones already known. For the remainder, however, there is nothing to go on.

    Remember when universities were bursting at the seams with students sitting in the aisles, balancing books on their knees? No more, it seems. E-learning is as likely to stand for empty lecture theatres as for the internet _______, which has greatly increased the volume and range of course materials available online in the past five years. "The ________ now is to simply think, 'Everything will be online so I don't need to go to class'," said Dr Kerri-Lee Krause, of the Centre for the Study of Higher Education at the University of Melbourne. The nation's universities are in the process of opening the doors for the new academic year and, while classes are generally well _________ for the early weeks, it often does not last. "There is concern at the university level about student attendance dropping and why students are not coming to lectures," Dr Krause said.

    School-to-work transition is a historically persistent topic of educational policymaking and reform that impacts national systems of vocational education and training. The transition process refers to a period between _______ of general education and the beginning of vocational education or the beginning of gainful employment as well as to training systems, institutions, and programs that prepare young people for careers. The status passage of youth from school-to-work has changed structurally under late modernism, and young people are forced to adapt to changing _______ of their environment especially when planning for entry into the labour market. Since the transition to a job is seen as a major success in life, youth who manage this step successfully are more optimistic about their future; till others are disillusioned and pushed to the margins of society. While some young people have developed _______ strategies to cope with these requirements, those undereducated and otherwise disadvantaged in society often face serious problems when trying to prepare for careers. Longer transitions lead to a greater vulnerability and to risky ________.

    demands vs necessities:
        In this context, "demands" is more appropriate than "necessities." "Demands" 
            implies the various requirements or expectations that the changing environment places on young people as they plan to enter the labor market. 
            It suggests the challenges and pressures they need to address or fulfill. 
        "Necessities" typically refers to 
            essential needs or requirements, which may not fully capture the dynamic and challenging nature of the changing environment mentioned in the sentence.
    :
    successful: 
        The word "successful" is used here to highlight that some young people have found effective strategies or approaches to handle the challenges presented by the transition from school to work. It emphasizes the positive outcome of their coping mechanisms.

        The use of "successful" contrasts with the later mention of those who are "undereducated and otherwise disadvantaged" and suggests that they may not have found equally effective strategies, leading to potential challenges in preparing for careers.
    :
    behaviours:
        "Longer transitions lead to greater vulnerability and to risky behaviors."

        In this context, "behaviors" is used to refer to the actions or conduct of individuals during the longer transitions from school to work. The term "risky behaviors" suggests that, as transitions extend over time, individuals might engage in actions that pose risks or challenges, potentially impacting their ability to successfully navigate the transition process.

        This phrase implies that the prolonged period of transition may lead to certain behaviors that are considered risky or detrimental to the individuals involved. It highlights the potential negative consequences associated with extended transitions.

    Smoking is still very _______ in certain places in the world. In Greece, 40% of people over the age of 15 are smokers. Belgium isn’t too far behind either, consuming a ______ amount of tobacco per capita annually. Part of this has to do with the public’s perception of smoking in these places. In Greece, for example, efforts to ban smoking in public are relatively ______ and not well-enforced. Efforts to curb smoking through taxation have largely failed as well; Greece, for one, has a large black market for cheaper cigarettes. The United States has seen a ______ drop in cigarette consumption over time, an important change given the importance of tobacco as a cash crop in the colonial days. ______ the reduction, the US still manages to make the top five in terms of tobacco consumption. For the most part, states have been free to regulate tobacco usage as they see fit. As a result, policies on smoking in public and the price of a pack of cigarettes _______ widely from one state to another. Regardless of particular state laws, it is increasingly more common for restaurants, offices, bars, and other businesses to proactively ban smoking on premises.

    Conservationists have long debated whether the koala should go on the Australian national threatened species list. ______ the koala is clearly in trouble in some parts of the country – in Queensland, for example, high numbers _______ by disease – in other parts such as Victoria and South Australia, the problem is not that koala populations _______, but that they have grown to the point where they are almost too numerous. For a species to be classed as vulnerable, its population _______ by more than 30 percent over the last three generations or 10 years. The problem is that when such a stipulation is applied to koalas, the Victorian boom offsets the Queensland bust, and the species stays off the list. This has repercussions because northern koalas are different to southern ones. They are smaller, for example, and they contain a genetic ______ not represented in the South. _______, a split listing has been devised koalas from New South Wales, the ACT and Queensland are now officially 'Vulnerable'; those from Victoria and South Australia are not considered threatened.

Discovered in the early 1800s and named nicotianine, the oily essence now called nicotine is the main active ingredient of tobacco. Nicotine, however, is only a small component of cigarette smoke, which contains more than 4,700 chemical compounds, including 43 cancer-causing substances. In recent times, scientific research has been providing evidence that years of cigarette smoking vastly increases the risk of developing fatal medical conditions. In addition to being responsible for more than 85 per cent of lung cancers, smoking is associated with cancers of, amongst others, the mouth, stomach and kidneys, and is thought to cause about 14 per cent of leukaemia and cervical cancers. In 1990, smoking caused more than 84,000 deaths, mainly resulting from such problems as pneumonia, bronchitis and influenza. Smoking, it is believed, is responsible for 30 per cent of all deaths from cancer and clearly represents the most important preventable cause of cancer in countries like the United States today. A recent study by researchers at the University of California at San Francisco (UCSF) has shown that second-hand cigarette smoke does more harm to non-smokers than to smokers. Leaving aside the philosophical question of whether anyone should have to breathe someone else’s cigarette smoke, the report suggests that the smoke experienced by many people in their daily lives is enough to produce substantial adverse effects on a person’s heart and lungs. The report, published in the Journal of the American Medical Association (AMA), was based on the researchers’ own earlier research but also includes a review of studies over the past few years. The American Medical Association represents about half of all US doctors and is a strong opponent of smoking. The study suggests that people who smoke cigarettes are continually damaging their cardiovascular system, which adapts in order to compensate for the effects of smoking. It further states that people who do not smoke do not have the benefit of their system adapting to the smoke inhalation. Consequently, the effects of passive smoking are far greater on non-smokers than on smokers.
Which of the statements can be proven from the passage?
Thirty per cent of deaths in the United States are caused by smoking-related diseases.

Leukaemia and Pneumonia are strongly liked to cigarette smoking

Opponents of the smoking financed the study of USCF

The American Medical Association represents exactly half the doctors of the US

Passive smoking is equally dangerous

Nicotine is the key elements of tobacco

Read the passage below and summarize it using one sentence. Type your response in the box at the bottom of the screen. You have 10 minutes to finish this task. Your response will be judged on the quality of your writing and on how well your response presents the key points in the passage.

What is the solution for nations with increasing energy demands, hindered by frequent power cuts and an inability to compete in the international oil market? For East Africa at least, experts think geothermal energy is the answer. More promising still, the Kenyan government and international investors seem to be listening. This is just in time according to many, as claims of an acute energy crisis are afoot due to high oil prices, population spikes and droughts. Geothermal energy works by pumping water into bedrock, where it is heated and returns to the surface as steam which is used directly as a heat source or to drive electricity production. Source: Energy Information Administration, Geothermal Energy in the Western United States and Hawaii. Currently over 60% of Kenya’s power comes from hydroelectric sources but these are proving increasingly unreliable as the issue of seasonal variation is intensified by erratic rain patterns. Alternative energy sources are needed; and the leading energy supplier in Kenya, Kenya Electricity Generating Company (KenGen), hopes to expand its geothermal energy supply from 13% to 25 % of its total usage by 2020. The potential of geothermal energy in the region was first realised internationally by the United Nations Development Program, when geologists observed thermal anomalies below the East African Rift system. Locals have been utilising this resource for centuries; using steam vents to create the perfect humidity for greenhouses, or simply to enjoy a swim in the many natural hot lakes. Along the 6000 km of the rift from the Red Sea to Mozambique, geochemical, geophysical and heat flow measurements were made to identify areas suitable for geothermal wells. One area lies next to the extinct Olkaria volcano, within the Hell’s Gate National Park, and sits over some of the thinnest continental crust on Earth. This is a result of the thinning of the crust by tectonic stretching, causing hotter material below the Earth’s surface to rise, resulting in higher temperatures. This thin crust was ideal for the drilling of geothermal wells, reaching depths of around 3000 m, where temperatures get up to 342°C, far higher than the usual temperature of 90°C at this depth. Water in the surrounding rocks is converted to steam by the heat. The steam can be used to drive turbines and produce electricity.

# Essay 

The mass media, including TV and newspaper, have a great influence on humans, particularly on the younger generation. What is your opinion?

The great influence of mass media on humans, particularly on the younger generation has become an integral part of the rising debate in the present world. While proponents of the argument are in favor, the opponents are completely against the relevance of the importance of mass media. In my opinion, the influence of mass media has more positive impacts than negatives around the globe.

To begin with, there are several factors, in favor of my belief. The most prominent reason is that the mass media provides several educational content. According to the research conducted by Western Sydney University, the students learn fifty percent of their school subjects by watcing TV. Secondly, newspapers expose world news to younger generation and make them well-informed about current affairs.

On the other hand, critics may point out that one of the most significant disadvantages of the influence of mass media is that the addiction of watching teledramas and TV series. For instance, a survey conducted in the United States reveals that the younger generation spends average of five hours a day watching TV.

In conclusion, even when there are a lot of demerits associated with the influence of the mass media, the advantages outweigh the disadvantages and the mass media such as TV and newspaper, have become a crucial part of our lives. Therefore, efficient use of mass media should be promoted. However, its misuse should be condemned.

    :
    :
    Emphasis:
        "Human factors, with its emphasis on user- or person-centered design" suggests that human factors places a strong focus on designing systems with consideration for the users or individuals involved.
        :
        "Emphasis" implies a strong prioritization or highlighting of a specific aspect, indicating that human factors places considerable importance or weight on user- or person-centered design. It suggests that this aspect is given special attention or prominence within the field.

        On the other hand, "focus" simply suggests directing attention towards something without necessarily implying the same level of significance or prioritization as "emphasis." While both words convey a similar idea of directing attention, "emphasis" carries a stronger connotation of significance and priority, which aligns better with the intended meaning in the passage.
    :
    Effective:
        "...the care provided is safe, effective, and efficient" indicates that human factors aims to ensure that the healthcare delivered in a home setting is not only safe but also achieves its intended outcomes in an effective and efficient manner.
    field vs profession :
        Field: 
            "Field" is commonly used to refer to a specific area of study or expertise. When we talk about human factors as a "field," we're referring to it as a defined discipline with its own theories, methodologies, and practices. It suggests that human factors is a well-established and recognized domain of study within which professionals work to optimize human well-being and system performance.
        Profession: 
            While "profession" could be applicable, 
            it tends to imply the career aspect of human factors 
            rather than its academic or scientific nature. 
            "Profession" might suggest the individuals working in the field rather than the field itself as an area of study.
        Profession:
            "According to the International Ergonomics Association, '[Human factors] is the scientific discipline...and the profession that applies theory, principles, data, and other methods to design..." clarifies that human factors is not only a scientific discipline but also a profession dedicated to applying its knowledge to design for optimal human well-being and system performance.
    Therefore:
        "Human factors is therefore concerned with applying what is known about human behavior..." connects the previous statement to the next, indicating that the profession of human factors is particularly concerned with applying knowledge about human behavior to design processes.
    Support:
        "...concerned with the design of training programs and instructional materials that support the performance of tasks or the use of technology/equipment" emphasizes that human factors involves designing training and instructional materials to support individuals in performing tasks or using technology and equipment effectively.

    In summary, the passage underscores the importance of human factors in designing systems, especially in the context of healthcare in home settings. It emphasizes the user-centered approach, effective care, and the profession's role in applying scientific knowledge to optimize human well-being and system performance, with a specific focus on supporting individuals in their tasks and technology use.

    "Emphasis" vs "focus" 
        Emphasis:
            Definition: Emphasis refers to the special importance, significance, or prominence given to something. It involves highlighting or giving extra weight to a particular element to make it stand out.
            Example: In the context of the provided passage, "emphasis on user- or person-centered design" means giving special importance or focus to designing systems with consideration for the users or individuals involved.
        Focus:
            Definition: Focus, on the other hand, refers to the center of attention or concentration. It is the act of directing attention, energy, or effort toward a specific object, task, or goal.
            Example: In the passage, "focus on user- or person-centered design" means directing attention and effort toward designing systems with a central consideration for the users or individuals involved.
        In summary, while both emphasis and focus involve directing attention or significance toward something, emphasis is more about giving special importance or prominence, whereas focus is about the act of concentrating attention on a specific target or goal. In the context of design or study, emphasis often involves making certain aspects stand out, while focus involves directing attention to a specific area or concept.

            Definition: A profession refers to a type of occupation, vocation, or career that requires specialized education, training, and expertise. Professionals in a particular field often adhere to a code of ethics, and their work is often governed by established standards and practices.
            Example: Medicine, law, engineering, and teaching are examples of professions. People in these fields typically have specialized education and training and may belong to professional organizations.
        Field:
            Definition: A field, in a broader sense, refers to a particular branch of study, work, or activity. It can encompass various professions, disciplines, or areas of expertise. A field may include multiple professions that contribute to the understanding or practice of a particular subject.
            Example: The field of healthcare includes various professions such as doctors, nurses, pharmacists, and medical researchers. Each of these professions contributes to the overall field of healthcare.
        In summary, a "profession" is a specific type of occupation that requires specialized knowledge and training, while a "field" is a broader category that encompasses various professions, disciplines, or areas of study. Professions can be seen as specialized components within a larger field.
    :
    therefore 
        It's a profession, therefore, it does these 
        The word "therefore" is suitable here as it indicates a logical consequence or conclusion, connecting the understanding of human factors to its application in the design of various elements.
    support vs assist :
        assist: Implies lending a helping hand or providing guidance to accomplish a task.
        "support" 
            is chosen for its versatility and neutrality, making it suitable for describing the multifaceted role of human factors in designing training programs and instructional materials.

    A Civil War reenactment is in part a memorial service. It is partly, too, a leisure activity. Furthermore most reenactors assert an educational import to the performance, and to develop their roles many pursue archival _________ with a rare dedication. On the other hand Civil War reenactments are increasingly commercial _______, with as many as fifty thousand North Americans routinely gathering at (or near) historical Civil War battlefields to stage performances that purport to recreate the conflict, while hundreds of thousands more spectate.

    I will show how theoretical issues of _______ arise as practical problems in the Civil War reenactment community by presenting my own observations from the 2006 Gettysburg reenactment and by ________ on a number of texts produced by participant-observers. In particular I will refer to Robert Lee Hodge, who was made famous by Tony Horwitz's 1996 book, Confederates in the Attic, and who served as a kind of Virgil to the author on his journey through a Confederate Valhalla. From these sources I will _______ that 'Living History' performances require an interpretive apparatus that takes genuine history as its authority, while remaining external to both participants and tourists, who may well be unaware of how closely their own involvement approximates genuine historical events.

    Umami was first identified in Japan, in 1908, when Dr. Kikunae Ikeda concluded that kombu, a type of edible seaweed, had a different taste than most foods. He conducted _______ that found that the high concentration of glutamate in kombu was what made it so tasty. From there, he crystallized monosodium glutamate (MSG), the seasoning that would become _______ the world over.Decades later, umami became scientifically defined as one of the five individual tastes sensed by receptors on the ______. Then in 1996, a team of University of Miami researchers studying taste perception made another breakthrough. They discovered separate taste receptor cells in the tongue for detecting umami. Before then, the concept was uncharted.

    "Up until our research, the ________ wisdom in the scientific community was that umami was not a separate sense. It was just a combination of the other four qualities (salty, sweet, bitter, sour)", explained Dr. Stephen Roper, the University of Miami physiology and biophysics professor who helped zero in on the taste along with Nirupa Chaudhari, the team's lead researcher.

    Peering into the future seldom produces a clear picture. But this is not the ________ with bio-energy. Its long-term impacts on the global economy appear to be pretty clear, making many long-term predictions quite compelling, including the demise of the price-setting power of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and the end of agricultural protectionism.

    First, technology is _______ to deliver a biofuel that will be competitive with fossil energy at something like current prices. It probably already has. Brazil has been exporting ethanol to the US at an average delivery price of $1.45 for an amount with the energy equivalence of a gallon of petrol. It is doing so profitably and in increasing amounts, in spite of a 54 cents a gallon tariff to protect American maize-based ethanol ________. Many countries are following suit.

    But ethanol is an inconvenient chemical compound that is corrosive and soluble in water, thus limiting its immediate market to that of a gasoline additive. However, this is just the Betamax phase of the industry. There is plenty of private venture capital money being _______ into finding more efficient ways of extracting energy from biomass and delivering it to transport and power systems. Over time, the technology will also become more flexible, allowing more crops to be used as feedstock, not just the current choice of sugarcane, maize and palm oil. New technologies will be able to extract energy from cellulose, allowing the use of pastures such as switch grass as well as the refuse of current food production.

    Global climate change is the greatest environmental challenge we face. We have at most a few decades to make the necessary investments to prevent the most serious impacts of climate change. Future generations will judge us based on the investments we are considering now.

    In its February 2007 report, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) warns that global emissions must peak no later than 2015 if we are to hold average global temperature increases to 2.4°C (4.3°F) or less. Moving to an emissions pathway that will hold temperature increases to a minimum will require a ______ effort. There is no time to lose given the long lag in research and development cycles, and energy-intensive ______ and product turnover.

    Fundamentally, ______ the world's energy system is unlikely to occur within this timeframe. It is thus imperative to find means to reduce the footprint of the existing system - most particularly, of coal, which is the most greenhouse gas intensive of the fossil fuels driving climate change. It is in this context that Carbon Dioxide Capture and Sequestration (CCS) becomes one of the most critical technologies in the menu of choices. It is the only option that provides a potentially near-term solution to rapidly expanding coal use here, in China and around the world. CCS must play the critical role of ______ growth in emissions from coal until other alternatives are ready.

Lingua Franca 

    English has emerged as the global lingua franca, spoken by a staggering one and a half billion individuals as a second language. It has become the language of ______ for individuals worldwide. However, with the ascendancy of English, the number of languages extant has dwindled significantly. Presently, we find ourselves with a mere 6,800 languages, a sharp decline from the multitude during the _______ of agriculture. The dominance of languages like English has expedited the _______ of others, witnessing the loss of approximately one language every fortnight. For _______ aspiring to master a unique language like Busuu, the urgency is palpable, considering that only eight individuals remain capable of _______ this linguistic knowledge to others. This accelerating erosion of linguistic diversity prompts reflection on the intricate tapestry of human expression, where the rise of one language signifies the fading whispers of countless others, each a repository of unique cultural narratives and perspectives.

Right pet 

    Choosing the right pet is akin to finding the best ______ on a desired item – it requires a careful balance. When selecting a pet, important factors include the pet's availability, the costs of care, and whether the pet _fits_ your lifestyle. The space you have, your budget, and the pet's needs are crucial considerations. The average annual cost of pet ownership ranges from $500 to $2,000, covering food, routine veterinary care, toys, and other supplies. Unexpected _expenses_, such as emergency veterinary services or behavioral training, can add to this. However, the companionship and mental health benefits that pets offer often _outweigh_ these costs. Pets provide unconditional love and can encourage a more active lifestyle. In conclusion, choosing a pet goes beyond their cuteness – it's a serious commitment with financial and lifestyle implications. _______, for many, the rewards of pet ownership justify the commitment.

Koala 

    Among those deeply committed to environmental protection, a persistent debate revolves around whether the koala should be officially _designated_ as a threatened species in Australia. The situation resembles a seesaw – in certain regions like Queensland, a _substantial_ number of koalas grapple with diseases, while in the southern territories of Victoria and South Australia, their population has seemingly exploded. The _criteria_ for labeling a species as 'vulnerable' dictate a population decrease of more than 30 percent in the last three generations or ten years. However, applying this rule to koalas introduces a nuanced complexity, as the surge in Victoria seems to offset the decline _observed_ in Queensland. The challenge is further compounded by the recognition that northern koalas and their southern counterparts represent distinct branches of the koala family tree. In response to this intricacy, authorities have chosen a bifurcated approach – koalas in New South Wales, the ACT, and Queensland are officially recognized as 'Vulnerable,' whereas those in Victoria and South Australia are not _____ at risk.

Cancer immunotherapy

    Cancer immunotherapy has emerged as a groundbreaking area in the _fight_ against cancer, leveraging the body's immune system to target and _eliminate_ cancer cells. One prominent approach involves checkpoint inhibitors, which block specific proteins that inhibit immune responses, allowing the immune system to recognize and attack cancer cells more effectively. Another promising avenue is adoptive cell therapy, ______ T cells are extracted from the patient, genetically modified to express receptors targeting cancer cells, and then reintroduced into the patient. CAR-T cell therapy, a notable example of adoptive cell therapy, has shown remarkable success in treating certain types of leukemia and lymphoma. Ongoing research is focused on refining these immunotherapeutic strategies, addressing challenges like treatment resistance and expanding their applicability to a _broader_ range of cancers.

    One of the clearest demonstrations that the magnificent brilliance of a star _originates_ from a modest aggregation of gas and dust was provided by detailed observations of young stellar objects in regions like the Orion Nebula. These nascent stars, resembling dimly lit spheres, often measure only a few million kilometers in diameter. Over time, the intense pressure and heat at their cores _initiate_ nuclear fusion, causing them to shine brightly. As these stars mature, they eject material, creating luminous jets and stellar winds. Stars develop into full maturity only when the conditions at their cores become hot enough for hydrogen fusion to commence. As a star's life _progresses_, it may enter various phases, often culminating in the formation of a red giant or a supernova. In the case of massive stars, the supernova explosion is a spectacular event, _casting_ off material into space. This material, rich in heavier elements formed during the star's life, then contributes to the creation of new stars and planets, continuing the cycle of stellar evolution.

Spinosaurus

    The largest predatory dinosaur to ever walk on Earth sported a massive sail that rose from its back. Its bony, muscular tail wouldn’t have had the same ____ of a whale or fish, and the heavy sail might have been more of an obstacle than a useful tool. If Spinosaurus was plunked down in deep water, the results wouldn’t have been very pleasant. This anatomical clue suggested Spinosaurus was “semiaquatic” and ____ into the shallow waters along river banks for its prey. Similar to some lizards today that have spine-supported sails, Spinosaurus likely used its sail during competition and courtship. Intriguingly, the dinosaur likely lived along marine and freshwater ______ like other semiaquatic reptiles, but it’s not something that any other extinct or ____ large aquatic vertebrates like ichthyosaurs or sea turtles did. So Spinosaurus would have prowled along coastal and inland waterways, ambushing prey as it waded into shallow waters.

3 robots 

    On a field in England, three robots have been given a mission:

    rig:
        Verb: To set up or arrange something, often in a skillful or clever manner. 
        However, "rig" doesn't quite fit the context of removing weeds; it's more associated with arranging or setting up.
    cultivate:
        Verb: To prepare and use land for crops or gardening. 
        While "cultivate" is related to working with land, it doesn't convey the idea of actively removing weeds. Instead, it implies preparing the land for desired plants.

        - destroy
        "to find and zap weeds with electricity"

Tax credits 

    As the new year begins, a ______ of popular electric vehicles, specifically some Tesla and General Motors models, could be eligible for $7,500 worth of tax credits they weren’t eligible for in 2022. That’s because limitations on new tax credits _______ in August as part of the Inflation Reduction Act won’t be put into force all at once, the Treasury Department announced this week. That means the rules will, temporarily, be more generous, allowing higher tax credits on more electric vehicles, for the first few months of the new year. Essentially, the tax rules are designed to _______ automakers to make their electric vehicles and all the parts of those vehicles, as much as possible, in the United States, or in countries with which the US has trade agreements. They’re also designed so tax credits don’t go to wealthy Americans buying expensive luxury vehicles. The latest announcement, which will temporarily open up more tax credit money, is likely mostly a good thing for consumers.

    number vs category:
        The word "number" is more appropriate in this context because it refers to a quantity or amount of popular electric vehicles that could be eligible for tax credits. 
        The sentence is discussing the potential eligibility for tax credits for a variety or quantity of electric vehicles, specifically some Tesla and General Motors models.
        Using "category" would imply a classification or group of electric vehicles, but the emphasis in this sentence is on the total count or quantity of vehicles that could qualify for tax credits. 
        Therefore, "number" is a more fitting term to convey the idea of multiple individual vehicles being eligible.
    enact -
        make a law or regulation

Half a lifetime ago I made a lifestyle choice to exchange a city terrace for a farm cottage. I knew it was a good idea because I had been there before. Born and reared on a farm, I had been seduced for a few years by the idea of being a big shot who lived and worked in a city rather than only going for the day to wave at the buses.

That also meant I was familiar with some of the minor disadvantages of country living, such as an uncertain water supply, the absence of central heating in most farm houses and a single-track road, easily blocked by snow, broken-down machinery or escaped farm animals.

But there were many advantages as I told my young wife back in the mid-Seventies. She might have been hard to persuade as she was town born and bred and eight months pregnant. I was trying to persuade her that exchanging a warm, large town house for a windswept farm cottage on a much lower income was a good idea.

    Since half a lifetime ago I made a lifestyle choice to exchange a city terrace for a farm cottage, I was familiar with some of the minor disadvantages of country living, such as an uncertain water supply, the absence of central heating or escaped farm animals, and she might have been hard to persuade as she was town born and bred and eight months pregnant.

    ---

    Certainly! If you want to keep it as one sentence, you can make some adjustments to the punctuation for clarity:

    "Since half a lifetime ago, when I made a lifestyle choice to exchange a city terrace for a farm cottage, I was familiar with some of the minor disadvantages of country living, such as an uncertain water supply, the absence of central heating, or escaped farm animals, and she might have been hard to persuade, as she was town-born and bred and eight months pregnant."

    Changes made:

    Added a comma after "half a lifetime ago" for clarity.
    Added a comma after "animals" to separate items in the list.
    Added a comma after "pregnant" to set off the introductory clause "as she was town-born and bred."

    The importance of changes in the means of communicating in society has become an integral part of the rising debate in the present world. While proponents of the argument are in favor, the opponents are completely against the relevance of the means of communicating in society today. In my opinion, the mediums used today for communication have more positive impacts than negatives around the globe.

    To begin with, there are several factors in favor of my belief. The most prominent one is that the effective communication skills are essential for personal and professional growth. According to the research conducted by Western Sydney University, majority of successful people agreed that they worked on their communication skills and made it more effective and interesting to succeed. Secondly, with the exposure of social media such as facebook and twitter, the means of communicating has become more challenging, yet more powerful.

    On the other hand, critics may point out that one of the most significant disadvantages is that communication is a soft skill but to be successful, more time need to be invested in learning hard skills. For instance, a survey conducted in the United States reveals that sixty percent of actors had struggled in the past, to catch up with rapidly changing means of communicating in society today.

    In conclusion, even when there a lot of demerits associated with the changes happened over the last ten years in terms of the means of communicating in society, the advantages outweigh the disadvantages and the means of communicating in society today has become a crucial part of our lives. Therefore, the efficient use of the means of communicating should be promoted. However, their misuse should be condemned.

    The means of communicating in society today has changed markedly over the last 10 years. In my opinion, this transformation has more positive impacts than negatives around the globe.

    To begin with, there are several factors in favor of my belief. The most prominent one is that effective communication has become more accessible and efficient. According to research conducted by Western Sydney University, individuals have reported improved connectivity and collaboration as a result of advancements in communication technology. Secondly, the widespread use of social media platforms such as Facebook and Twitter has facilitated instant global communication, breaking down geographical barriers and fostering a sense of interconnectedness.

    On the other hand, critics may point out that one of the most significant disadvantages of the evolving means of communication is the potential for information overload and the difficulty in discerning credible sources. For instance, a survey conducted in the United States reveals that a considerable percentage of the population has struggled to navigate the rapidly changing landscape of information dissemination, leading to misinformation and confusion.

    In conclusion, even when there are a lot of demerits associated with the changes in the means of communication over the last ten years, the advantages outweigh the disadvantages, and communication has become a crucial part of our lives. Therefore, the efficient use of communication tools should be promoted. However, their misuse should be condemned. It is essential to strike a balance between embracing technological advancements in communication and ensuring responsible and discerning usage.

    However:
        Meaning:    - contrast 
            "However" is used to introduce a contrast or contradiction to the previous statement. 
            It signals a shift in direction or thought.
        Example: 
            The weather forecast predicted rain; however, the sun was shining brightly when we stepped outside.
            The initial study indicated a preference for the traditional teaching method; however, subsequent research revealed that digital learning tools were equally effective.

    Nevertheless:
        Meaning:    - not totally contrast 
            "Nevertheless" is used to introduce a contrasting idea or concession. 
            It acknowledges the preceding information but indicates that the following statement is still true.
        Example: 
            The movie received mixed reviews; nevertheless, it was a box office success.
            The project faced several challenges; nevertheless, the team persevered and successfully met the deadline.

    Therefore:
        Meaning: 
            "Therefore" is a conjunctive adverb that indicates a logical result or conclusion based on the information presented earlier. 
            It implies cause and effect.
        Example: 
            The experiment yielded consistent results; therefore, we can conclude that the hypothesis was accurate.

    Whereas:
        Meaning: 
            "Whereas" is used to introduce a contrast or comparison between two different ideas or facts.
        Example: 
            She enjoys reading fantasy novels, whereas her brother prefers historical non-fiction.
    :
    :
    Yes, the sentence you provided is a perfectly valid use of "however" at the beginning. 
    Here's the sentence with a slight adjustment for clarity:

    Example:

        However, the subconscious brain recognized a rotated version of the same symbol as different; the conscious brain reasoned that "an apple is still an apple whether rotated or not," the researchers on the project concluded.
        
        Starting the sentence with "however" helps to emphasize the contrast between the subconscious brain's recognition and the conscious brain's reasoning. It's a clear and effective way to signal a shift in the direction of thought.

    In many cases, "that" and "which" can be used interchangeably when introducing restrictive clauses. 
    However, there is a subtle difference in how they are used:

    "That" is used for essential or restrictive clauses. 
        These are clauses that are necessary to the meaning of the sentence. 
        In this context, the sentence implies that the intellectualization of our relationship to phones is a reason why Brian Merchant's book comes as a relief. 
        The use of "that" would align with this idea.

    "Which" is used for non-restrictive or non-essential clauses. 
        These are clauses that provide additional information but are not crucial to the sentence's main meaning. 
        In this context, using "which" suggests that the insufficient intellectualization of our relationship to phones is a general observation, and the book coming as a relief is a separate point.

    So, both "that" and "which" could work in your sentence, and the choice depends on the nuance you want to convey. Using "that" might imply a more direct connection between the intellectualization and the relief brought by the book, while "which" might introduce a slightly more detached observation.

    The research challenges the ongoing trend across higher education institutes (HEIs) of _____ on experiential learning, and suggests that universities need to reconsider their approach if they ______ increase entrepreneurship among their students.
    Ms Inna Kozlinska, research associate at Aston Business School and author of the study, said: 'Entrepreneurship education _____ as a major force capable of generating long-term socio-economic changes through developing entrepreneurial, creative, flexible and wise individuals. There is an ongoing shift towards experiential learning in business school, ______ there is little empirical evidence to suggest this approach has better impact than traditional learning'.

    Learning to write well in college means learning (or re-learning) how to write clearly and plainly. Now that doesn't mean that plainness is the only good style, or that you should become a _slave_ to spare, unadorned writing. Formality and ornateness have their place, and in _competent_ hands complexity can take us on a dizzying, breathtaking journey. But most students, most of the time should _endeavor_ to be sensibly simple to develop a baseline style of short words, active verbs and relatively simple sentence _carrying_ clear actions or identities. It's faster, it makes arguments easier to follow, it increases the chances a busy reader will bother to pay attention, and it lets you _center_ more attention on your moments of rhetorical flourish which I do not advise abandoning altogether.
    :
    :
    :
    :
    1. **slave:** The sentence is contrasting different writing styles, including writing clearly and plainly versus using formal or ornate language. Using the term "slave" metaphorically here suggests that writers shouldn't feel bound or overly committed to just one style of writing, such as plainness. It helps to emphasize that while plain writing is good, it shouldn't be the only style used.

    2. **competent:** In the context of this passage, "competent hands" refers to skilled writers who can handle complex styles of writing. The term "competent" implies a level of mastery or skill in handling complexity in writing, taking readers on a "dizzying, breathtaking journey."

    3. **endeavor:** This term means to try or strive to achieve something. In this context, students should try to adopt a sensibly simple writing style most of the time. The word captures the notion that this is something worth working towards, though not always easy to achieve.

    4. **carrying:** In the sentence, the term "carrying" refers to the function of the simple sentences in conveying or "carrying" clear actions or identities. The simple sentences act as vehicles to deliver clear and unambiguous meaning, thus the word "carrying" is used metaphorically to represent this function.

    5. **center:** To "center" something means to make it the focus or central point. The advice in this context is to allow the simple and clear writing style to enable the writer to focus more attention on moments of rhetorical flourish. By making the main argument clear and simple, the writer can emphasize and draw attention to specific rhetorical devices or flourishes, making them the center of attention.

    The passage provides advice on writing in college, emphasizing the importance of clarity and simplicity while also recognizing the value of complexity and ornamentation when used skillfully. The chosen answers reflect this nuanced view of writing styles.

# Essay 

The mass media has become an integral part of the rising debate in the present world. While proponents of the argument are in favor, the opponents are completely against the relevance of violent scenes promoted in the mass media. In my opinion, the mass media has more positive impacts than negatives around the globe.

To begin with, there are several factors in favor of my belief. The most prominent one is that media brings us news from all over the world. According to the research conducted by Western Sydney University, the people around the world are interconnected fifty percentages more than the last decade. Secondly, general people get to express their opinions via mass media.

On the other hand, critics may point out that one of the most significant disadvantages is that young adults learn violence by watching media such as television and youtube. For instance, a survey conducted in the United States reveals that the preference towards violoence has increased by twenty percentage in the year 2023.

In conclusion, even when there are a lot of demerits associated with the usage of mass media, media has become a crucial part of our lives. Therefore, the efficient use of media should be promoted. However, its misuse should be condemned.

The teaching of languages could be revolutionised following ground-breaking research by Victoria University, New Zealand, PhD graduate Paul Sulzberger. Dr Sulzberger has found that the best way to learn a language is through frequent exposure to its sound patterns--even if you haven't a _____ what it all means. "However crazy it might sound, just listening to the language, ______ you don't understand it, is critical. A lot of language teachers may not accept that," he says. "Our ability to learn new words is directly related to how often we have been exposed to the particular combinations of the sounds which make ______ the words. If you want to learn Spanish, for example, frequently listening to a Spanish language radio station on the internet will dramatically ______ your ability to pick up the language and learn new words." Dr Sulzberger's research challenges existing language learning theory. His main hypothesis is that simply listening to a new language sets up the structures in the brain _______ to learn the words.

A few summers ago I visited two dairy farms, Huls Farm and Gardar Farm, which despite being located thousands of miles apart were still remarkably similar in their strengths and vulnerabilities. Both were by far the largest, most prosperous, most technologically advanced farms in their respective districts. In particular, each was centered around a magnificent state-of-the-art barn for _____ and milking cows. Those structures, both neatly _______ into opposite-facing rows of cow stalls, dwarfed all other barns in the district. Both farms let their cows _____ outdoors in lush pastures during the summer, produced their hay to harvest in the late summer for feeding the cows through the winter, and ______ their production of summer fodder and winter hay by irrigating their fields. The two farms were similar in an area (a few square miles) and barn size, Huls barn holding somewhat more cows than Gardar barn (200 vs 165 cows, respectively). The owners of both farms were viewed as leaders of their _______ societies. Both owners were deeply religious. Both farms were located in gorgeous natural settings that attract tourists from afar, with backdrops of high snow-capped mountains drained by streams teaming with fish, and sloping down to a famous river (below Huls Farm) or fjord (below Gardar Farm)

Origins of sexism 


advent vs invent 

    For most of our history, we have been hunter-gatherers, and patrilocal residence is not the norm among modern hunter-gatherer societies. Instead, either partner may move to live with the “in-laws”, or a couple may _relocate_ away from both their families. According to the scientist, a degree of egalitarianism is built into these systems. If they reflect what prehistoric hunter-gatherers did, women in those early societies would have had the choice of support from the group they grew up with, or the option to move away from _oppression_. According to one school of thought, things changed around 12,000 years ago. With the 1.____ of agriculture and homesteading, people began settling down. They acquired resources to defend, and power _shifted_ to the physically stronger males. Fathers, sons, uncles and grandfathers began living near each other, property was passed down the male line, and female autonomy was eroded. As a result, the argument goes, patriarchy emerged.

    "Advent" and "invent" are two distinct words with different meanings:
    Advent:
        Meaning: "Advent" refers to the arrival, appearance, or occurrence of an important event, person, or thing. 
        It often signifies the beginning or the coming into existence of something noteworthy.
        Example: "The advent of the internet revolutionized communication."
    Invent:
        Meaning: "Invent" means to create or originate something new, especially a product, device, or idea, that did not exist before. It involves the act of coming up with a novel concept or creation.
        Example: "Thomas Edison invented the electric light bulb."
        In summary, "advent" is about the arrival or onset of something, often referring to a significant event or development. On the other hand, "invent" is about the creation of something entirely new, involving the introduction of a novel idea or product.
    :
    Homesteading 
        is a lifestyle of self-sufficiency. It is characterized by subsistence agriculture, home preservation of food, and may also involve the small scale production of textiles, clothing, and craft work for household use or sale.

counterfactuals 

    In an often-cited study about counterfactuals, Medvec, Madey, and Gilovich (1995) found that bronze medalists appeared happier than silver medalists in television coverage of the 1992 Summer Olympics. Medvec et al. ________ that bronze medalists compared themselves to 4th place finishers, _____________ silver medalists compared themselves to gold medalists. These counterfactuals were the most ____________ because they were either qualitatively different (gold vs. silver) or categorically different (medal vs. no medal) from what _____________ occurred. Drawing on archival data and experimental studies, we show that Olympic athletes (among others) are more likely to make counterfactual comparisons based on their ___________ expectations, consistent with decision affect theory. Silver medalists are more likely to be disappointed because their personal expectations are higher than ________ of bronze medalists.

        These are hypothetical scenarios that explore what might have been

        In the context of the provided passage, the term "counterfactuals" is used 
        to discuss the comparisons that individuals make regarding their achievements, particularly in the case of Olympic medalists. The passage suggests that bronze medalists, for example, might compare themselves to those who finished in 4th place (a counterfactual scenario), while silver medalists might compare themselves to gold medalists. These comparisons involve imagining alternative outcomes that did not occur but could influence individuals' perceptions of success or failure.
    :
    In the provided sentence, the term "counterfactuals" refers to imagined scenarios or comparisons that did not happen in reality but are being considered for analysis or discussion. The sentence is explaining why these counterfactuals are particularly noteworthy or significant.

    Breaking down the sentence:
    "These counterfactuals were the most salient..."
    The word "salient" means prominent, noticeable, or important. 
    The sentence is stating that among various counterfactual scenarios, 
    the ones being discussed are the most prominent or significant.
    "...because they were either qualitatively different (gold vs. silver) or categorically different (medal vs. no medal) 
    from what actually occurred."
    The reason these particular counterfactuals are considered most salient is 
    because they involve differences in quality (gold vs. silver) or category (medal vs. no medal) compared to what really happened.
    So, the sentence is emphasizing that the counterfactual scenarios being discussed are especially notable because they deviate in terms of quality or category from the actual outcomes or events that took place.

Lizard 

When it comes to lizard sex, size does matter. 
But not in the way you might think. 
Because in the June 4th online issue of the journal Current Biology, ____ say that for at least one type of lizard, larger eggs are more likely to make girls while smaller eggs yield boys. 
For many animals, the sex of an individual is dictated solely by its _____. But for small alpine lizards, gender isn't so cut-and-dried. The scientists had earlier found that nest temperature can _____ the sex of lizard hatchlings. Cooler nests turn out more boys—no matter what their chromosomes say. At the same time, the researchers noticed that larger eggs seemed to make more _______. But they wanted to put their observation to the test. So they took big eggs and removed some yolk—and, voila, they made males. 
Adding yolk to a little egg was a recipe for a female. This size ______ might allow moms to balance their babies' sexes when a chilly nest would otherwise produce mostly sons. Because when it comes to alpine lizards, sex _______ all comes down to a ________ yolk.

    :
    manacle - one / 2 metal bands joined by a chain 
                handcuffs / chains 
    :
    The term "practical" is used in a metaphorical sense in the given sentence 
    to suggest that the yolk has a functional or effective role in determining the sex of alpine lizards. 
    The choice of "practical" implies that the yolk serves a useful and purposeful function 
    in the process of sex determination.

    Researchers have _discovered_ that improving voter turnout tends to result in better _decision-making_ at least amongst fish. A recent study of _stickleback_ found that they select a leader by consensus and, the more fish in the pool, the more likely they'll make a good choice. In the experiment, a school of fish was presented with two mock _candidates_ for leader. One of the fake fish swam left, the other right. The pack of real fish was then allowed to decide which leader to follow. _According_ to the study, which was published recently in the journal Current Biology, the stickleback tended to follow the candidate that looked the healthiest. Larger or fatter fish, for example, were usually chosen over smaller fish. Fish with spots—often a telltale sign of disease— ___________ lost out to a non-spotty adversary. The fish also seemed to have a preference for a more richly colored candidate, though the researchers say they have yet to determine why. Maybe his _______ record won them over?

Ubiquitous bubbles 
    https://www.languageacademy.com.au/admin/practice/0/12/22508/1/all/0/all/none?page=1&search=&random=663798338

    Let's raise a toast to champagne. And its ubiquitous bubbles. 
    Because new _research_ says the bubbles aren't just tickling your tongue. They're erupting with aromas vital to the taste of the beverage. A team of (who else) French researchers used mass spectrometry to nose around a glass of champagne. They found that concentrations of certain _molecular_ compounds were higher at the surface of the glass than in the liquid itself. They report the finding in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. The _scientists_ say the sea shares champagne's secret. If you've ever enjoyed ocean air, it's because compounds called _surfactants_ are dragged along with bubbles in the waves. When those bubbles burst, the surfactants break into smaller molecules called aerosols that are suspended in the breeze, giving coastal areas their distinctive oceany odor. In essence, a glass of champagne hosts a small version of this process, but the bubbles bring more appetizing aerosols to the surface. Legend has it that Dom Perignon shouted "I'm tasting the stars" when he uncorked his first bottle of champagne. But it was physics and chemistry, not astronomy, that he was really _____.
    :
    :
    chastening, savoring, wakening, disabling

    ans:
        savoring - taste and enjoy it to the full

Evolution at work 
https://www.languageacademy.com.au/admin/practice/0/12/22508/1/all/0/all/none?page=1&search=&random=663798338

    
    If you want to see evolution at work, visit a hospital. Inside a sick patient, antibiotics wipe out _infectious_ bacteria by the millions. But germs are always _mutating_. A few adapt to resist the drug, so they survive—and spread. Such antibiotic-resistant bacteria infect two million Americans every year; they kill 23,000. In this arms race between medicine and evolution, evolution is winning. But could we turn evolution against bacteria? It turns out that when bacteria mutate to become resistant to one antibiotic, they often become more vulnerable to a _different_ drug. So maybe after a jab with the left, a roundhouse to the right will deliver a _knockout_ blow. To test this idea, researchers in Denmark dosed batches of E. coli with 23 different antibiotics, and waited for resistance to evolve. In three quarters of the cases, the mutant germs became more ______ to a second drug. The work appears in the journal Science Translational Medicine. One particular combination of widely used antibiotics—gentamicin, then cefuroxime, then gentamicin again, and so on—looks like it could hold the bugs at bay indefinitely.

    sustainable, liable, dependent, susceptible 
    :
    :
    :
    :
    ans - susceptible
    :
    Susceptible 
        in this context means that the mutant germs became more vulnerable or prone to the effects of a second drug. 
        It suggests that, after mutating to resist one antibiotic, the bacteria became more susceptible to another drug.
        So, the filled-in blank would be: "In three quarters of the cases, the mutant germs became more susceptible to a second drug."

# Essay


The importance of education has become an integral part of the rising debate in the present world. While proponents of the argument are in favor, the opponents are completely against the relevance of education in preparing the future workforce. In my opinion, society with good members has more positive impacts than negatives around the globe.

To begin with, there are several factors, in favor of my belief. The most prominent one is that the education plays a vital role in preparing future workforce by providing the knowledge and expertise to the members of the society. According the research conducted by Western Sydney University, ninty percentage of successful entrepreneurs accept the fact that education has given them the edge to succeed in their personal and professional lives. Secondly, education provides the global exposure to individuals to learn other cultures which leads to a peaceful society.

On the other hand, critics may point out that one of the most significant disadvantages is that education fosters competition in individuals and that becomes unhealthy in some situations. For instance, a survey conducted in the United States reveals that forty percentage of professionally successful people admit that they don't lead a life with self-fulfillment because of the stress and anxiety.

In conclusion, even when there are a lot of demerits associated with the purpose of education in preparing the future workforce and building a society of good members, the advantages outweigh the disadvantages and the importance of education has become a crucial part of our lives. Therefore, the efficient use of education should be promoted. However, its misuse should be condemned.

    It may take even more than *_changes_ in the financial and cultural structures of employment
    :
    goods or trade 
        In the given sentence, the more appropriate word to fill in the blank would be "goods."

        The sentence would read: 
            "She says the U.S. market for goods, has become skewed by the assumption of full-time, two-career households."

            This usage aligns with the context of the sentence, indicating that the market for products or commodities (goods) in the U.S. has been influenced by the assumption of full-time, two-career households.
    :
    "Full-time, two-career households" 
        refers to households in which both partners or members are engaged in full-time employment or careers. Specifically:

    Full-time: 
        Both individuals in the household are employed on a full-time basis, typically working the standard number of hours considered full-time in their respective occupations.

    Two-career: 
        Both individuals pursue careers, indicating that they are not just part-time or occasional workers but are actively engaged in long-term, professional employment.

    In summary, a "full-time, two-career household" describes a family or household structure where both partners are working full-time jobs in their respective careers, highlighting a commitment to full-time employment and career development for each member. This kind of household structure can have implications for various aspects of life, including economic dynamics, work-life balance, and consumer behaviors.
    :
    "Skewed" 
        means that something is not balanced or symmetrical. 
        In a figurative sense, when information, data, or a situation is described as "skewed," it implies that there is a lack of fairness, accuracy, or impartiality. 
        It suggests that the situation or representation is distorted or biased in some way.

    For example, 
        in the sentence you provided earlier: 
        "She says the U.S. market for goods has become skewed by the assumption of full-time, two-career households," it suggests that the U.S. market for goods is influenced or distorted by the assumption that households are predominantly full-time, two-career households. 
        This assumption may lead to an unbalanced or biased representation of consumer preferences and needs in the market.
    :
    :    
    "Not even the humblest household object is made without a microprocessor."
        In this sentence, the term "microprocessor" 
        is used to emphasize the ubiquity and integration of advanced technology. It suggests that even the simplest or most basic household items now incorporate microprocessors, highlighting the widespread influence of technology in modern manufacturing.

According to the research conducted by Western Sydney University, educated people lead a satisfied life. Secondly, education is not only the basic requirement to become successful in any profession, but also educated people help others to become successful in their professions.

On the other hand, critics may point out that one of the most significant disadvantages of the topic is that the students go through a lot of stress and anxiety when studying for exams. For instance, a survey conducted in the United States reveals that there a number suicide attempts recorded among final year college students. Furthermore, secondary and tertiary education consume almost 20 years of a person's life which is a very long period of time.

In conclusion, even when there are a lot of demerits associated with building a society of good members, the advantages outweigh the disadvantages and the education has become a crucial part of our lives. Therefore, the efficient use of education should be promoted. However, its misuse should be condemned.

Today's technology has changed the shopping

The researchers had a hunch a bug like this might exist 

--------

Because a new study shows that social influence can sway people's _______ and render the crowd ______.

    eminence, insolence, estimate, imminence 
    correct, entrenched, incorrect, divided 

    eminence, insolence:

    "Eminence" refers to high status, distinction, or prominence.
    "Insolence" refers to disrespectful or rude behavior.
    These words don't seem to fit the context of the sentence. Social influence typically doesn't sway people's insolence, and rendering the crowd insolent doesn't align with the idea presented in the sentence.
    estimate, imminence:

    "Estimate" refers to an approximate calculation or judgment.
    "Imminence" refers to the state of being about to happen or occur soon.
    In the context of the sentence, "estimate" is more suitable as it aligns with the idea that social influence can affect people's judgments.

But psychology and statistics don't _____ 

    differ, mix, agree, tell 
    :
    ans: mix 
    :
    The word "agree" could also be a valid choice in the sentence, depending on the intended meaning. Let's explore both options:

    "But psychology and statistics don't mix":

    This suggests a lack of compatibility or harmony between psychology and statistics. It implies that these two fields may not easily combine or work well together in a certain context.
    "But psychology and statistics don't agree":

    This suggests a lack of agreement or consensus between psychology and statistics. It implies that these two fields may have conflicting viewpoints or findings.
    Both options can be grammatically correct, but they convey slightly different meanings. The choice between "mix" and "agree" depends on the specific nuance or implication the speaker or writer wants to convey in the given context. If the intention is to emphasize a lack of compatibility, "mix" might be more suitable. If the emphasis is on conflicting perspectives or findings, "agree" could work.

Sedentary

    Currently, there is concern about the increasing amount of time children spend 1___ in sedentary activities, the number of children who fail to achieve 2____ daily physical activity guidelines (i.e. 60 min of moderate-to vigorous intensity activities every day), and the apparent increase in obesity prevalence as a result of such sedentary 3____. Screen-based activities, including television viewing and playing computer games, are 4___ of the most frequently observed sedentary activities that children partake with children spending 2.5–4 h per day participating in such activities. The introduction of “active video games” (AVGs) into the gaming market presents an opportunity to convert traditional, sedentary screen-time in to active screen-time and thus increase total daily energy expenditure (EE). Modern AVGs utilize cameras and motion sensors to allow the gamer to physically perform a variety of actions, dependent on the console, such as swinging a tennis racquet or running. The most demanding AVGs provided similar responses to walking and, based on international standards, should be classified as low-intensity activities. Whilst AVGs may provide children with a better alternative to sedentary gaming, they are not a sufficient 5___ for normal physical activity, e.g. sports and outdoor play.

Platypus
    https://www.apeuni.com/en/practice/fib_wr/707

    The platypus looks like no other creature on Earth. Physically, it appears to be a hybrid blend of a bird, beaver, reptile and otter, with additional characteristics not contained in any of these four. On cursory examination, the platypus has a bill that most 1_____ that of a waterfowl, not the mouth of any known mammal. Yet it is not an ordinary bill. It is actually a well-designed sensory organ. Not a nose, but a highly sensitive electro-location sensor, detecting miniscule electrical impulses generated by its food source of small crustaceans and worms. No other mammal has a sensor so highly 2_____ in fact; only one other mammal has this ability at all. Then 3_____ are the webbed feet, similar to those found on otters. Unlike an otter, however, the webbing is far more pronounced on the front feet of the platypus, which it uses like paddles for swimming. 4_____ in the water, the back feet are tucked into its body and hardly used at all.

            The word "alike" could also be used in the context of the sentence, and it would make sense. Both "resembles" and "alike" convey a sense of similarity, but "resembles" is slightly more specific and commonly used when comparing the appearance of one thing to another.
            So, the sentence could indeed read:
            "On cursory examination, the platypus has a bill that most 1. alike that of a waterfowl, not the mouth of any known mammal."
            This choice would also be acceptable, emphasizing the similarity between the platypus's bill and that of a waterfowl. Both "resembles" and "alike" work in this context, and the choice between them often depends on stylistic preferences.

        A "cursory examination" refers to 
            a brief and hasty inspection or review of something. It implies a quick and superficial look without delving into detailed or thorough scrutiny.

Roommate 

    If you’re choosing to use the random 1___ or are letting the college choose your roommate for you, you’ll probably have to fill out some kind of profile or questionnaire. These usually include things like: what time do you usually go to bed, where do you prefer to study, do you keep your space clean or are you more messy, etc. When you’re answering these questions, be as honest as possible. If there’s something you’re dead set against (e.g., a roommate who smokes) you can mark that and you will not be paired with someone who fits that criteria. Choosing a roommate can be kind of 2____. In some cases, it can feel like as big of a decision as actually choosing which school to attend. But don’t worry, if you get to campus and live with your roommate for a few weeks and find out that your lifestyles are just too different, you can always move. I 3____ roommates my first semester of college, and after I moved my college experience was much more positive. In fact, I lived with different people every year of college and it all worked out. So have fun with it! Be open to meeting new people and trying new things. Sometimes the best roommates are the ones that are completely different than you because they cannot only 4_____ you to new cultural 5_____, but they can also expand your ways of thinking and isn’t that what college is all about?

        mating: 
            While "mating" generally refers to the process of animals coming together for the purpose of reproduction, it's not suitable in the context of choosing roommates. The word has a specific biological connotation and doesn't convey the idea of individuals being selected to share a living space.

        picking: 
            "Picking" could work in the context, but it might not capture the formal or systematic nature of the process. "Picking" could imply a more casual or arbitrary approach, whereas the context suggests a more deliberate and organized roommate selection process.

        looking: 
            While "looking" could work grammatically, it doesn't convey the idea of a specific matching or selection process. It's more general and might not capture the intention of actively choosing or being assigned a roommate.

        The word "swapped" 
            is used in the context of the sentence to convey that the speaker exchanged or changed roommates during their first semester of college. Let's explore the other options:

        asked: 
            While it's possible to use "asked" in this context, it doesn't specifically convey the idea of a roommate exchange or change. It's a more general term that might not capture the nature of the action described.

        stayed: 
            This word implies remaining in the same situation, which contradicts the context of the sentence where the speaker is discussing changing roommates.

        picked: 
            While "picked" could be used, it might not fully capture the idea of a mutual or agreed-upon exchange. "Picked" implies a more unilateral decision.

        "Swapped" 
            is the most fitting term because it accurately communicates the action of exchanging roommates during the speaker's first semester of college. It suggests a mutual agreement or decision between the speaker and the other person involved in the swap.

Dictionary 

    The famous dictionary of Samuel Johnson, published in London in 1755; its principles dominated English 1_____ for more than a century. This two-volume work surpassed earlier dictionaries not in 2______ but in the precision of definition. Its strength lay in two features: the original carefully divided and ordered, elegantly formulated definitions of the main word stock of the language; and the copious citation of quotations from the entire range of English literature, which served in support and illustration and which 3______ the different shades of meaning of a particular word. 
    A Dictionary of the English Language included a history of the language, a grammar, and an extensive list of words representing basic general vocabulary, based on the best conversation of 4______ London and the normal usage of respected writers. The original was followed in 1756 by an abbreviated one-volume version that was widely used far into the 20th century. Johnson's accomplishment was to provide for the English language a dictionary that incorporated with skill and intellectual power the 5_____ ideals and resources and the best available techniques of European lexicography.

Mount Everest 

    Mount Everest called Chomolungma ("goddess mother of the world") in Tibet and Sagarmatha ("goddess of the sky") in Nepal, Mount Everest once went by the pedestrian name of Peak XV among Westerners. That was before _____ established that it was the highest mountain on Earth, a fact that came as something of a surprise—Peak XV had seemed lost in the crowd of other formidable Himalayan peaks, many of which gave the _____ of greater height. In 1852, the Great Trigonometrical Survey of India measured Everest's elevation as 29,002 feet above sea level. This figure remained the officially ____ height for more than one hundred years. In 1955, it was adjusted by a mere 26 feet to 29,028 (8,848 m) The mountain received its official name in 1865 in honor of Sir George Everest, the British Surveyor General from 1830—1843 who had mapped the Indian subcontinent. He had some ______ about having his name bestowed on the peak, arguing that the mountain should retain its local appellation, the standard policy of geographical societies. Before the Survey of India, a number of other mountains ranked supreme in the eyes of the world. In the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, the Andean peak Chimborazo was considered the highest. At a relatively unremarkable 20,561 feet (6,310 m), it is in fact nowhere near the highest, _______ by about thirty other Andean peaks and several dozen in the Himalayas. In 1809, the Himalayan peak Dhaulagiri (26,810 ft.; 8,172 m) was declared the ultimate, only to be shunted aside in 1840 by Kanchenjunga (28,208 ft.; 8,598 m), which today ranks third. Everest's status has been unrivalled for the last century-and-a-half, but not without a few threats.

Programs 

    The six programs represented here report that word of mouth is by far their most ____ recruitment tool, particularly because it typically yields candidates who are similar to previously successful candidates. Moreover, satisfied candidates and school systems are likely to ____ the word without any special _____ on the part of their program. Other, less personal advertising approaches, such as radio and television spots and local newspaper advertisements, have also proven fruitful, _____ for newer programs. New York uses a print advertising campaign to inspire dissatisfied professionals to become teachers. Subway posters send provocative messages to burned-out or disillusioned professionals. “Tired of diminishing returns? Invest in NYC kids” was just one of many Madison Avenue-inspired invitations. News coverage has also proven to be a ______ to alternative programs.

        effort vs ...
            In this context, "effort" refers to a deliberate or conscious attempt to promote the program. The sentence suggests that the positive reputation and success of the program are sufficient to inspire people to share their experiences without the need for active promotion or marketing efforts from the program itself. 

        Boon: 
            A boon refers to something that is helpful, advantageous, or beneficial. It's often used to describe something that brings a favorable result or contributes positively to a situation.
        
        Compliment: 
            A "compliment" typically refers to a polite expression of praise or admiration. It can be a positive comment or remark about someone or something.

            In the sentence, the emphasis is on news coverage being a positive and advantageous factor for alternative programs. The use of "boon" suggests that the news coverage has brought significant benefits, such as increased interest and applications. On the other hand, "compliment" wouldn't fit as well because it doesn't capture the sense of a substantial positive impact or advantage.


------------------

The debate on whether Australia will have a nation-wide carbon trading scheme ended last week with the government committed to a national emissions scheme from 2012. However, the decision-making as to how we power the economy in a carbon constrained world is only just beginning. Fossil fuels like coal and oil have underpinned our economic growth and standard of living for decades. The current resources boom is there because other countries want our fossil fuels, and for all these reasons it is profitable to keep mining them. Ironically, the income may help develop the technologies to replace them, but it is a matter of which and when. Almost certainly, in the race to reduce emissions, new technologies such as solar, wind and geothermal (heat from rocks) power will compete against gas, clean coal, and perhaps nuclear energy to win the hearts and minds of the business world. In the end, business will favour whatever is a cheap, abundant, and reliable solution. You can imagine the lobbying that will ensue from the different interest groups, to attract business capital and government support so that their technology wins out. There may be many collapsed ventures and lost fortunes along the way.
Which of the following statements are true according to the passage?
Fossil fuels will continue to be used because it is profitable.

New technologies will replace the fossil fuels in the future.

Carbon emission rules will cripple new energy sources.

Solar, wind, and geothermal energy will survive.

Many oil and gas companies will lose their business in the future.

Eutrophication

        deplete     ...

    deplete vs destroy 

        In the context of eutrophication, the term "deplete" is more appropriate than "destroy" to convey the idea that excessive growth of algae and other aquatic species may lead to a reduction or exhaustion of minerals in the water. Let's break down the sentence:

        "The water becomes overly enriched with minerals and nutrients which induce excessive growth of algae and other aquatic species which may deplete minerals in the water, thus endanger other species."

        Deplete: "Deplete" means to reduce or diminish the quantity or completeness of something. In this context, it suggests that the excessive growth of algae and other aquatic species may use up or reduce the availability of minerals in the water.

        Destroy: "Destroy" implies causing complete and irreversible damage or annihilation. While eutrophication can have negative effects on the ecosystem, using "destroy" in this context might be too strong because it doesn't accurately capture the gradual and reversible nature of the impact on minerals in the water.

    upsetting vs marred:

        "Marred" is used to convey the idea that the preparations were affected or impaired by the construction delays, which aligns with the challenges faced. However, the overall tone of the sentence suggests that despite these difficulties, the Athens games turned out well, making "marred" a more fitting choice than "upsetting." "Upsetting" might have been too strong a term for the overall positive outcome described in the sentence.

    Ponzi 

        Charles Ponzi was an Italian-born American swindler and con artist, born on March 3, 1882, and died on January 18, 1949. 
        He became infamous for his fraudulent investment scheme known as the "Ponzi scheme," which is a type of scam that promises high returns with little risk to investors. 
        The scheme leads investors to believe that profits are coming from legitimate business activities when, in reality, they are derived from the funds of new investors.

        Ponzi's most well-known scheme involved the arbitrage of international reply coupons, a form of currency used for replying to international mail. 
        He promised investors high returns within a short period by exploiting differences in the price of these coupons in various countries.

        Eventually, Ponzi's scheme collapsed as it became unsustainable, and he was exposed as a fraudster. 
        The term "Ponzi scheme" has since been used to describe similar investment scams that follow a similar fraudulent structure. Ponzi schemes rely on a continuous influx of new investment to provide returns to earlier investors, creating a deceptive cycle that ultimately leads to financial losses for many participants.

Unemployment was the overriding fact of life when Franklin D. Roosevelt became president of the United States on March 4, 1933. An anomaly of the time was that the government did not systematically collect statistics of joblessness; actually it did not start doing so until 1940. The Bureau of Labor Statistics later estimated that 12,830,000 persons were out of work in 1933, about one-fourth of a civilian labor force of more than 51 million. Roosevelt signed the Federal Emergency Relief Act on May 12, 1933. The president selected Harry L. Hopkins, who headed the New York relief program, to run FERA. A gifted administrator, Hopkins quickly put the program into high gear. He gathered a small staff in Washington and brought the state relief organizations into the FERA system. While the agency tried to provide all the necessities, food came first. City dwellers usually got an allowance for fuel, and rent for one month was provided in case of eviction.

concerned
 that I’m going to pigeon-hole myself too early in the course. Lisa: Yeah, hmmm. Brad: As you know there are going to be 
interviews
 for summer clerkships coming up and I really don’t want to come across as too focused on certain areas that a lot of firms don’t even do, you know, have a practice in. Lisa: Well, don’t forget, um, only about 25% of the course at this stage is elective-based and you’ll still have that core of subjects－crim, legal institutions, 
evidence
 , property law, general commercial and fed-con law, all of which would be of interest to a lot of firms. So if I were you, which I’m not, I’d really just go with what my interests are, and enjoy the chance to undertake some work in an area that I’m 
motivated
 to pursue. Don’t you think? There’s an awful lot of time in this profession where you’ll be undertaking long, stressful hours on projects that don’t really interest you as much.

The importance of the mental health in the modern lifestyle has become an integral part of the rising debate in the present world. While proponents of the argument are in favor, however, the opponents are completely against the relevance of investing effort in developing a good mental health in this fast-paced life. In my opinion, the activities that help to improve physical and mental health have more positive impacts than negatives around the globe.

To begin with, there are several factors in favor of my belief. The most prominent reason is that the calm and clear mind can do wonders in studies, sports, as well as business. According to the research conducted by Western Sydney University, the top scoring students, high performing athletes, and successful businessmen take a good care of their mental health. Secondly, the modern lifestyle applies too much stress in every human being. It's very important to be mindful of the stress factors in order to keep them in control.

On the other hand, critics may point out that one of the most significant disadvantages of the good mental health is that the people who are happy are not driven towards a goal. For instance, a survey conducted in United States reveals that there are two types of stresses. They are eustress and distress.

In conclusion, even when there are a lot of demerits associated with the maintaining good mental health in the modern life, the advantages outweigh the disadvantages and the importance of mental health has become a crucial part of our lives. Therefore, the efficient use of the activities which build good mental health should be promoted. However, its misuse should be condemned.

Jane Goodall 

    The 20th century saw two groundbreaking figures in animal research: Konrad Lorenz and Jane Goodall. While Lorenz focused on instinctual behavior in birds, Goodall revolutionized our understanding of primates, particularly chimpanzees. Prior to her work, ___ was known about the complex social lives and cognitive abilities of these intelligent animals. Goodall's pioneering research, conducted in Tanzania's Gombe Stream National Park, revealed chimps to be capable of tool use, complex communication, and even self-awareness. Born in London in 1934, Goodall's passion for animals manifested early.

    ChatGPT 
    You can use "a little" in the sentence to convey a slightly different meaning. The choice between "little" and "a little" depends on the nuance you want to express:

    "Prior to her work, little was known..."

    This suggests that very little information was known about the complex social lives and cognitive abilities of chimpanzees. It emphasizes the scarcity or lack of knowledge.
    "Prior to her work, a little was known..."

    This suggests that some information was known but not necessarily a significant amount. It implies that there was at least some knowledge, though not a substantial amount.
    In the context of Jane Goodall's groundbreaking research, which significantly expanded our understanding of chimpanzees, the use of "little" without the indefinite article "a" may emphasize the limited knowledge that existed before her work. However, both options are grammatically correct, and the choice depends on the specific nuance you want to convey.

        Here's the breakdown:

and lay new pipes. When it comes to managing waste water, new systems are 2_____, such as Advanced Immobilized Cell Reactor technology, which uses a system based on the immobilization of bacteria, reducing the power and land area needed for conventional waste water treatment systems.

A Massey University ecologis has teamed up with a leading wildlife photographer to produce the definitive book on New Zealand's national bird, the kiwi. Kiwi: A National History was written by Dr Isabel Castro and 1_____ (has featured, features, featured, was featured) photographs by Rod Marris.

    :
    :
    ChatGPT 
        prefers - features         
            Let's examine each option:

            "has featured": This would imply that the book has already been published, and the photographs by Rod Marris were part of its features in the past. However, the context of the sentence suggests that the book is being introduced or presented, so this tense doesn't align.

            "features": This is the correct choice. It indicates that the book, "Kiwi: A National History," includes photographs by Rod Marris. It fits well with the present context of introducing the book.

            "featured": This would suggest that the book had photographs by Rod Marris in the past, which might not be the intended meaning in the context. It doesn't align with the present introduction of the book.

            "was featured": This would imply that the book was featured in the past, which is not the intended meaning. The focus should be on the current status of the book and its content.

            The choice of "features" is appropriate because it conveys that the book, at the time of introduction, includes photographs by Rod Marris.
        :
        :
        "Kiwi: A National History was written by Dr Isabel Castro and was featured photographs by Rod Marris."
        In this case, "was featured" implies that the photographs by Rod Marris were highlighted or prominently presented in the book. Both "features" and "was featured" can be suitable, and the choice might depend on subtle nuances in emphasis or personal writing style.

Sharks killed four people and injured 58 others around the world in 2006, a comparatively dull year for dangerous encounters between the two species.

Sharks killed four people and injured 58 others around the world in 2006, a comparatively dull year for dangerous encounters between the two species. Sharkbite numbers ____ steadily over the last century as humans reproduced exponentially and ___ more time at the seashore. But the numbers have ___ over the past ﬁve years as overﬁshing ____ the shark population near shore and swimmers have ___ about the risks of wading into certain areas, Burg
:
>> grew, spent, stabilized, thinned, learned 
:
I see the confusion. 
The sentence structure you're suggesting, "But the numbers have thinned over the past five years as overfishing stabilized the shark population near shore," presents a logical inconsistency.

When we say "numbers have thinned," it typically implies a decrease or reduction in quantity, while "stabilized" suggests maintaining a constant level. These two terms are contradictory in this context. If overfishing had stabilized the shark population near shore, it would mean keeping it at a consistent level, not causing it to thin or decrease.

The original completion, "But the numbers have stabilized over the past five years as overfishing thinned the shark population near shore," is more coherent and internally consistent. It suggests that the shark population near shore has stabilized after a period of overfishing that thinned their numbers.
