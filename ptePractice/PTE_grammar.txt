            Referred to:
                "The study of objects constitutes a relatively new field of academic enquiry, commonly referred to as material culture studies." This sentence introduces the idea that the study of objects is a new academic field known as material culture studies.
            Observation:
                "Students of material culture seek to understand societies, both past and present, through careful study and observation of the physical or material objects generated by those societies." Here, it explains that students in this field aim to understand societies by carefully studying and observing the physical objects created by those societies.
            Including:
                "The source material for study is exceptionally wide, including not just human-made artifacts but also natural objects and even preserved body parts." This highlights the broad range of source materials for study, encompassing not only human-made artifacts but also natural objects and preserved body parts.
            Supreme:
                "Some specialists in the field of material culture have made bold claims for its pre-eminence. In certain disciplines, it reigns supreme." This suggests that in certain academic disciplines, material culture studies is considered pre-eminent or superior.
            In Such Cases:
                "It plays a critical role in archaeology, for example, especially in circumstances where written evidence is either patchy or non-existent. In such cases, objects are all scholars have to rely on in forming an understanding of ancient peoples." Here, it explains that material culture studies are particularly crucial in archaeology when written evidence is lacking or incomplete.
            As In:
                "Even where written documents survive, the physical remains of literate cultures often help to provide new and interesting insights into how people once lived and thought, as in the case of medieval and post-medieval archaeology." This points out that even when written documents exist, the physical remains of literate cultures (objects) offer valuable insights into the lives and thoughts of people, especially in the context of medieval and post-medieval archaeology.

            In summary, the passage discusses the field of material culture studies, its importance in understanding societies through the observation of various objects, its broad scope of source materials, its pre-eminence in certain disciplines, and its critical role in archaeology, both in the absence and presence of written evidence. The passage emphasizes the diverse meanings objects hold for different people in historical and cultural contexts.
