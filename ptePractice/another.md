Summarize 

Since the co-evolutionary relationship between cows and grass is one of nature's underappreciated wonders; it also happens to be the key to understanding just about everything about modern meat, In exchange for these services, the grasses offer ruminants a plentiful and exclusive supply of lunch, and truly this is an excellent system for all concerned; for the grasses, for the bacteria, for the animals, and for us, the animal eater.

Since when Australians engage in debate about educational quality or equity, they often seem to accept that a country cannot achieve both at the same time, evidence from New South Wales will be used to illustrate this point, and even in countries where the diagnosis might be less extreme, the capacity of schooling to build social cohesion is often diminished by the way in which schools separate individuals and groups.

The purpose of education has become an integral part of the rising debate in the present world. While proponents of the argument are in favor, the opponents are completely against the relevance of the education. In my opinion, preparing future workforce and making good members of society have more positive impacts than negatives around the globe.

To begin with, there are several factors in favor of my belief. The most prominent one is that the education provides a global exposure to individuals which leads to self-fulfillment. According to the research conducted by Western Sydney University, educated people lead a satisfied life. Secondly, education is not only the basic requirement to become successful in any profession, but also educated people help others to become successful in their professions.

On the other hand, critics may point out that one of the most significant disadvantages of the topic is that the students go through a lot of stress and anxiety when studying for exams. For instance, a survey conducted in the United States reveals that there a number suicide attempts recorded among final year college students. Furthermore, secondary and tertiary education consume almost 20 years of a person's life which is a very long period of time.

In conclusion, even when there are a lot of demerits associated with building a society of good members, the advantages outweigh the disadvantages and the education has become a crucial part of our lives. Therefore, the efficient use of education should be promoted. However, its misuse should be condemned.

The main focus of the lecture was about the children and schools. The first crucial aspect revealed in the discourse was that school choice recognizes that the children are different by nature. Furthermore, another significant point mentioned about one size fits all education and nurture questions. In conclusion, the lecture suggested that the schools tailor to their child needs impact child's success and happiness.


The main focus of the lecture was about the gallery and the interesting bus. The first crucial was that the great English scientist Newton building royal society. Furthermore, another significant point mentioned about walking up to the north side. Additionally, the lecture also presented important information about royal academy of science and arts. In conclusion, the lecture suggested that the architecture, science and painting are essential.

Today's technology has changed the shopping

The researchers had a hunch a bug like this might exist 

--------

Because a new study shows that social influence can sway people's _______ and render the crowd ______.

    eminence, insolence, estimate, imminence 
    correct, entrenched, incorrect, divided 

    eminence, insolence:

    "Eminence" refers to high status, distinction, or prominence.
    "Insolence" refers to disrespectful or rude behavior.
    These words don't seem to fit the context of the sentence. Social influence typically doesn't sway people's insolence, and rendering the crowd insolent doesn't align with the idea presented in the sentence.
    estimate, imminence:

    "Estimate" refers to an approximate calculation or judgment.
    "Imminence" refers to the state of being about to happen or occur soon.
    In the context of the sentence, "estimate" is more suitable as it aligns with the idea that social influence can affect people's judgments.

But psychology and statistics don't _____ 

    differ, mix, agree, tell 
    :
    ans: mix 
    :
    The word "agree" could also be a valid choice in the sentence, depending on the intended meaning. Let's explore both options:

    "But psychology and statistics don't mix":

    This suggests a lack of compatibility or harmony between psychology and statistics. It implies that these two fields may not easily combine or work well together in a certain context.
    "But psychology and statistics don't agree":

    This suggests a lack of agreement or consensus between psychology and statistics. It implies that these two fields may have conflicting viewpoints or findings.
    Both options can be grammatically correct, but they convey slightly different meanings. The choice between "mix" and "agree" depends on the specific nuance or implication the speaker or writer wants to convey in the given context. If the intention is to emphasize a lack of compatibility, "mix" might be more suitable. If the emphasis is on conflicting perspectives or findings, "agree" could work.

Sedentary

    Currently, there is concern about the increasing amount of time children spend 1___ in sedentary activities, the number of children who fail to achieve 2____ daily physical activity guidelines (i.e. 60 min of moderate-to vigorous intensity activities every day), and the apparent increase in obesity prevalence as a result of such sedentary 3____. Screen-based activities, including television viewing and playing computer games, are 4___ of the most frequently observed sedentary activities that children partake with children spending 2.5–4 h per day participating in such activities. The introduction of “active video games” (AVGs) into the gaming market presents an opportunity to convert traditional, sedentary screen-time in to active screen-time and thus increase total daily energy expenditure (EE). Modern AVGs utilize cameras and motion sensors to allow the gamer to physically perform a variety of actions, dependent on the console, such as swinging a tennis racquet or running. The most demanding AVGs provided similar responses to walking and, based on international standards, should be classified as low-intensity activities. Whilst AVGs may provide children with a better alternative to sedentary gaming, they are not a sufficient 5___ for normal physical activity, e.g. sports and outdoor play.

Platypus

    The platypus looks like no other creature on Earth. Physically, it appears to be a hybrid blend of a bird, beaver, reptile and otter, with additional characteristics not contained in any of these four. On cursory examination, the platypus has a bill that most 1_____ that of a waterfowl, not the mouth of any known mammal. Yet it is not an ordinary bill. It is actually a well-designed sensory organ. Not a nose, but a highly sensitive electro-location sensor, detecting miniscule electrical impulses generated by its food source of small crustaceans and worms. No other mammal has a sensor so highly 2_____ in fact; only one other mammal has this ability at all. Then 3_____ are the webbed feet, similar to those found on otters. Unlike an otter, however, the webbing is far more pronounced on the front feet of the platypus, which it uses like paddles for swimming. 4_____ in the water, the back feet are tucked into its body and hardly used at all.

        resembles vs alike:
            The word "alike" could also be used in the context of the sentence, and it would make sense. Both "resembles" and "alike" convey a sense of similarity, but "resembles" is slightly more specific and commonly used when comparing the appearance of one thing to another.
            So, the sentence could indeed read:
            "On cursory examination, the platypus has a bill that most 1. alike that of a waterfowl, not the mouth of any known mammal."
            This choice would also be acceptable, emphasizing the similarity between the platypus's bill and that of a waterfowl. Both "resembles" and "alike" work in this context, and the choice between them often depends on stylistic preferences.

        A "cursory examination" refers to 
            a brief and hasty inspection or review of something. It implies a quick and superficial look without delving into detailed or thorough scrutiny.

Roommate 

    If you’re choosing to use the random 1___ or are letting the college choose your roommate for you, you’ll probably have to fill out some kind of profile or questionnaire. These usually include things like: what time do you usually go to bed, where do you prefer to study, do you keep your space clean or are you more messy, etc. When you’re answering these questions, be as honest as possible. If there’s something you’re dead set against (e.g., a roommate who smokes) you can mark that and you will not be paired with someone who fits that criteria. Choosing a roommate can be kind of 2____. In some cases, it can feel like as big of a decision as actually choosing which school to attend. But don’t worry, if you get to campus and live with your roommate for a few weeks and find out that your lifestyles are just too different, you can always move. I 3____ roommates my first semester of college, and after I moved my college experience was much more positive. In fact, I lived with different people every year of college and it all worked out. So have fun with it! Be open to meeting new people and trying new things. Sometimes the best roommates are the ones that are completely different than you because they cannot only 4_____ you to new cultural 5_____, but they can also expand your ways of thinking and isn’t that what college is all about?

    pairing vs 

        mating: 
            While "mating" generally refers to the process of animals coming together for the purpose of reproduction, it's not suitable in the context of choosing roommates. The word has a specific biological connotation and doesn't convey the idea of individuals being selected to share a living space.

        picking: 
            "Picking" could work in the context, but it might not capture the formal or systematic nature of the process. "Picking" could imply a more casual or arbitrary approach, whereas the context suggests a more deliberate and organized roommate selection process.

        looking: 
            While "looking" could work grammatically, it doesn't convey the idea of a specific matching or selection process. It's more general and might not capture the intention of actively choosing or being assigned a roommate.

    swapped vs picked 
        swapped:

                if you get to campus and live with your roommate for a few weeks and find out that your lifestyles are just too different, you can always move. I 3____ roommates my first semester of college

        The word "swapped" 
            is used in the context of the sentence to convey that the speaker exchanged or changed roommates during their first semester of college. Let's explore the other options:

        asked: 
            While it's possible to use "asked" in this context, it doesn't specifically convey the idea of a roommate exchange or change. It's a more general term that might not capture the nature of the action described.

        stayed: 
            This word implies remaining in the same situation, which contradicts the context of the sentence where the speaker is discussing changing roommates.

        picked: 
            While "picked" could be used, it might not fully capture the idea of a mutual or agreed-upon exchange. "Picked" implies a more unilateral decision.

        "Swapped" 
            is the most fitting term because it accurately communicates the action of exchanging roommates during the speaker's first semester of college. It suggests a mutual agreement or decision between the speaker and the other person involved in the swap.

Dictionary 

    The famous dictionary of Samuel Johnson, published in London in 1755; its principles dominated English 1_____ for more than a century. This two-volume work surpassed earlier dictionaries not in 2______ but in the precision of definition. Its strength lay in two features: the original carefully divided and ordered, elegantly formulated definitions of the main word stock of the language; and the copious citation of quotations from the entire range of English literature, which served in support and illustration and which 3______ the different shades of meaning of a particular word. 
    A Dictionary of the English Language included a history of the language, a grammar, and an extensive list of words representing basic general vocabulary, based on the best conversation of 4______ London and the normal usage of respected writers. The original was followed in 1756 by an abbreviated one-volume version that was widely used far into the 20th century. Johnson's accomplishment was to provide for the English language a dictionary that incorporated with skill and intellectual power the 5_____ ideals and resources and the best available techniques of European lexicography. It was the standard English dictionary until Noah Webster' s.

    hieroglyph: 
        This term refers to a character or symbol representing a word, syllable, or sound, often used in ancient writing systems. It doesn't fit the context, as it doesn't relate to Samuel Johnson's dictionary or English lexicography.

    hierarchy: 
        This term refers to a system or organization in which people or groups are ranked one above the other. 
        While related to the general idea of organization, it doesn't specifically relate to dictionaries or lexicography.

        This term refers to the science of classification, specifically in biology. 
        It doesn't fit the context of English dictionaries and lexicography.

Mount Everest 

    Mount Everest called Chomolungma ("goddess mother of the world") in Tibet and Sagarmatha ("goddess of the sky") in Nepal, Mount Everest once went by the pedestrian name of Peak XV among Westerners. That was before _____ established that it was the highest mountain on Earth, a fact that came as something of a surprise—Peak XV had seemed lost in the crowd of other formidable Himalayan peaks, many of which gave the _____ of greater height. In 1852, the Great Trigonometrical Survey of India measured Everest's elevation as 29,002 feet above sea level. This figure remained the officially ____ height for more than one hundred years. In 1955, it was adjusted by a mere 26 feet to 29,028 (8,848 m) The mountain received its official name in 1865 in honor of Sir George Everest, the British Surveyor General from 1830—1843 who had mapped the Indian subcontinent. He had some ______ about having his name bestowed on the peak, arguing that the mountain should retain its local appellation, the standard policy of geographical societies. Before the Survey of India, a number of other mountains ranked supreme in the eyes of the world. In the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, the Andean peak Chimborazo was considered the highest. At a relatively unremarkable 20,561 feet (6,310 m), it is in fact nowhere near the highest, _______ by about thirty other Andean peaks and several dozen in the Himalayas. In 1809, the Himalayan peak Dhaulagiri (26,810 ft.; 8,172 m) was declared the ultimate, only to be shunted aside in 1840 by Kanchenjunga (28,208 ft.; 8,598 m), which today ranks third. Everest's status has been unrivalled for the last century-and-a-half, but not without a few threats.

Programs 

    The six programs represented here report that word of mouth is by far their most ____ recruitment tool, particularly because it typically yields candidates who are similar to previously successful candidates. Moreover, satisfied candidates and school systems are likely to ____ the word without any special _____ on the part of their program. Other, less personal advertising approaches, such as radio and television spots and local newspaper advertisements, have also proven fruitful, _____ for newer programs. New York uses a print advertising campaign to inspire dissatisfied professionals to become teachers. Subway posters send provocative messages to burned-out or disillusioned professionals. “Tired of diminishing returns? Invest in NYC kids” was just one of many Madison Avenue-inspired invitations. News coverage has also proven to be a ______ to alternative programs. When the New York Times, for example, ran a story about the district’s alternative route program, 2,100 applications flooded in over the next six weeks.

        effort vs ...
            In this context, "effort" refers to a deliberate or conscious attempt to promote the program. The sentence suggests that the positive reputation and success of the program are sufficient to inspire people to share their experiences without the need for active promotion or marketing efforts from the program itself. 

        Boon: 
            A boon refers to something that is helpful, advantageous, or beneficial. It's often used to describe something that brings a favorable result or contributes positively to a situation.
        
        Compliment: 
            A "compliment" typically refers to a polite expression of praise or admiration. It can be a positive comment or remark about someone or something.

            In the sentence, the emphasis is on news coverage being a positive and advantageous factor for alternative programs. The use of "boon" suggests that the news coverage has brought significant benefits, such as increased interest and applications. On the other hand, "compliment" wouldn't fit as well because it doesn't capture the sense of a substantial positive impact or advantage.

The debate on whether Australia will have a nation-wide carbon trading scheme ended last week with the government committed to a national emissions scheme from 2012. However, the decision-making as to how we power the economy in a carbon constrained world is only just beginning. Fossil fuels like coal and oil have underpinned our economic growth and standard of living for decades. The current resources boom is there because other countries want our fossil fuels, and for all these reasons it is profitable to keep mining them. Ironically, the income may help develop the technologies to replace them, but it is a matter of which and when. Almost certainly, in the race to reduce emissions, new technologies such as solar, wind and geothermal (heat from rocks) power will compete against gas, clean coal, and perhaps nuclear energy to win the hearts and minds of the business world. In the end, business will favour whatever is a cheap, abundant, and reliable solution. You can imagine the lobbying that will ensue from the different interest groups, to attract business capital and government support so that their technology wins out. There may be many collapsed ventures and lost fortunes along the way.
Which of the following statements are true according to the passage?
Fossil fuels will continue to be used because it is profitable.

New technologies will replace the fossil fuels in the future.

Carbon emission rules will cripple new energy sources.

Solar, wind, and geothermal energy will survive.

Many oil and gas companies will lose their business in the future.

Eutrophication

        algae 
        deplete     ...

    deplete vs destroy 

        In the context of eutrophication, the term "deplete" is more appropriate than "destroy" to convey the idea that excessive growth of algae and other aquatic species may lead to a reduction or exhaustion of minerals in the water. Let's break down the sentence:

        "The water becomes overly enriched with minerals and nutrients which induce excessive growth of algae and other aquatic species which may deplete minerals in the water, thus endanger other species."

        Deplete: "Deplete" means to reduce or diminish the quantity or completeness of something. In this context, it suggests that the excessive growth of algae and other aquatic species may use up or reduce the availability of minerals in the water.

        Destroy: "Destroy" implies causing complete and irreversible damage or annihilation. While eutrophication can have negative effects on the ecosystem, using "destroy" in this context might be too strong because it doesn't accurately capture the gradual and reversible nature of the impact on minerals in the water.

    upsetting vs marred:

        "Marred" is used to convey the idea that the preparations were affected or impaired by the construction delays, which aligns with the challenges faced. However, the overall tone of the sentence suggests that despite these difficulties, the Athens games turned out well, making "marred" a more fitting choice than "upsetting." "Upsetting" might have been too strong a term for the overall positive outcome described in the sentence.

    Ponzi 

        Charles Ponzi was an Italian-born American swindler and con artist, born on March 3, 1882, and died on January 18, 1949. 
        He became infamous for his fraudulent investment scheme known as the "Ponzi scheme," which is a type of scam that promises high returns with little risk to investors. 
        The scheme leads investors to believe that profits are coming from legitimate business activities when, in reality, they are derived from the funds of new investors.

        Ponzi's most well-known scheme involved the arbitrage of international reply coupons, a form of currency used for replying to international mail. 
        He promised investors high returns within a short period by exploiting differences in the price of these coupons in various countries.

        Eventually, Ponzi's scheme collapsed as it became unsustainable, and he was exposed as a fraudster. 
        The term "Ponzi scheme" has since been used to describe similar investment scams that follow a similar fraudulent structure. Ponzi schemes rely on a continuous influx of new investment to provide returns to earlier investors, creating a deceptive cycle that ultimately leads to financial losses for many participants.

Unemployment was the overriding fact of life when Franklin D. Roosevelt became president of the United States on March 4, 1933. An anomaly of the time was that the government did not systematically collect statistics of joblessness; actually it did not start doing so until 1940. The Bureau of Labor Statistics later estimated that 12,830,000 persons were out of work in 1933, about one-fourth of a civilian labor force of more than 51 million. Roosevelt signed the Federal Emergency Relief Act on May 12, 1933. The president selected Harry L. Hopkins, who headed the New York relief program, to run FERA. A gifted administrator, Hopkins quickly put the program into high gear. He gathered a small staff in Washington and brought the state relief organizations into the FERA system. While the agency tried to provide all the necessities, food came first. City dwellers usually got an allowance for fuel, and rent for one month was provided in case of eviction.
This passage is primarily about...
unemployment in the 1930s.

the effect of unemployment on United States families.

The main focus was proof reading. The first crucial aspect was that the punctuation and grammar are easy to spot when you look at your own. Furthermore, lecture mentioned about being mindful of what kind of errors you are looking for because the big picture is just as important. In conclusion, the lecture suggeted that to give a day or two to get sufficient break.

The main focus was about Australians using cars for transportation. The first aspect revealed was that the commuters rely on public transport. Furthermore, the lecture pointed out that because of the special Australian living patterns, most Australians need a car. Additionally, the lecture mentioned about the transportation systems in rural areas. In conclusion, the lecture suggested that the cities have plenty of room for improvement.

A new process for 3D-printing things could pave the way for lighter, faster aircraft that 
potentially
 fly further on the same amount of fuel. Today’s aeroplanes are held together with thousands of metal rivets and fasteners. That’s because the lightweight but strong 
aluminum
 alloys used for their frames are considered unweldable. Try to weld them and you get a phenomenon called hot-cracking, in which the finished alloy weakens and 
fractures
 as it cools. This and other adverse welding effects also stand in the way of 3D-printing high-strength aluminium alloy parts. When researchers have tried, the resulting laser-fused mass 
flakes
 away at the welding area like a stale biscuit.


Brad: As I was saying, Professor Mitchell…. Lisa: Oh, please call me Lisa. Brad: Yes, well Lisa, well I’m still trying to get my head around the choice of 
electives
 for the optional part of the third year program. I was thinking of taking personal taxation law, and company tax, together with the extra five-credit-point course on goods and services and VAT type taxes, but I’m a bit 
concerned
 that I’m going to pigeon-hole myself too early in the course. Lisa: Yeah, hmmm. Brad: As you know there are going to be 
interviews
 for summer clerkships coming up and I really don’t want to come across as too focused on certain areas that a lot of firms don’t even do, you know, have a practice in. Lisa: Well, don’t forget, um, only about 25% of the course at this stage is elective-based and you’ll still have that core of subjects－crim, legal institutions, 
evidence
 , property law, general commercial and fed-con law, all of which would be of interest to a lot of firms. So if I were you, which I’m not, I’d really just go with what my interests are, and enjoy the chance to undertake some work in an area that I’m 
motivated
 to pursue. Don’t you think? There’s an awful lot of time in this profession where you’ll be undertaking long, stressful hours on projects that don’t really interest you as much.

The importance of the mental health in the modern lifestyle has become an integral part of the rising debate in the present world. While proponents of the argument are in favor, however, the opponents are completely against the relevance of investing effort in developing a good mental health in this fast-paced life. In my opinion, the activities that help to improve physical and mental health have more positive impacts than negatives around the globe.

To begin with, there are several factors in favor of my belief. The most prominent reason is that the calm and clear mind can do wonders in studies, sports, as well as business. According to the research conducted by Western Sydney University, the top scoring students, high performing athletes, and successful businessmen take a good care of their mental health. Secondly, the modern lifestyle applies too much stress in every human being. It's very important to be mindful of the stress factors in order to keep them in control.

On the other hand, critics may point out that one of the most significant disadvantages of the good mental health is that the people who are happy are not driven towards a goal. For instance, a survey conducted in United States reveals that there are two types of stresses. They are eustress and distress.

In conclusion, even when there are a lot of demerits associated with the maintaining good mental health in the modern life, the advantages outweigh the disadvantages and the importance of mental health has become a crucial part of our lives. Therefore, the efficient use of the activities which build good mental health should be promoted. However, its misuse should be condemned.

Jane Goodall 

    The 20th century saw two groundbreaking figures in animal research: Konrad Lorenz and Jane Goodall. While Lorenz focused on instinctual behavior in birds, Goodall revolutionized our understanding of primates, particularly chimpanzees. Prior to her work, ___ was known about the complex social lives and cognitive abilities of these intelligent animals. Goodall's pioneering research, conducted in Tanzania's Gombe Stream National Park, revealed chimps to be capable of tool use, complex communication, and even self-awareness. Born in London in 1934, Goodall's passion for animals manifested early.

    ChatGPT 
    You can use "a little" in the sentence to convey a slightly different meaning. The choice between "little" and "a little" depends on the nuance you want to express:

    "Prior to her work, little was known..."

    This suggests that very little information was known about the complex social lives and cognitive abilities of chimpanzees. It emphasizes the scarcity or lack of knowledge.
    "Prior to her work, a little was known..."

    This suggests that some information was known but not necessarily a significant amount. It implies that there was at least some knowledge, though not a substantial amount.
    In the context of Jane Goodall's groundbreaking research, which significantly expanded our understanding of chimpanzees, the use of "little" without the indefinite article "a" may emphasize the limited knowledge that existed before her work. However, both options are grammatically correct, and the choice depends on the specific nuance you want to convey.

Sharks killed four people and injured 58 others around the world in 2006, a comparatively dull year for dangerous encounters between the two species.

Sharks killed four people and injured 58 others around the world in 2006, a comparatively dull year for dangerous encounters between the two species. Sharkbite numbers ____ steadily over the last century as humans reproduced exponentially and ___ more time at the seashore. But the numbers have ___ over the past ﬁve years as overﬁshing ____ the shark population near shore and swimmers have ___ about the risks of wading into certain areas, Burg
:
>> grew, spent, stabilized, thinned, learned 
:
I see the confusion. 
The sentence structure you're suggesting, "But the numbers have thinned over the past five years as overfishing stabilized the shark population near shore," presents a logical inconsistency.

When we say "numbers have thinned," it typically implies a decrease or reduction in quantity, while "stabilized" suggests maintaining a constant level. These two terms are contradictory in this context. If overfishing had stabilized the shark population near shore, it would mean keeping it at a consistent level, not causing it to thin or decrease.

The original completion, "But the numbers have stabilized over the past five years as overfishing thinned the shark population near shore," is more coherent and internally consistent. It suggests that the shark population near shore has stabilized after a period of overfishing that thinned their numbers.
